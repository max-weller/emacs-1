* Installation Changes in Emacs 24.4

** Emacs can now be compiled with ACL support.
This happens by default if a suitable support library is found at
build time, like libacl on GNU/Linux.  To prevent this, use the
configure option `--disable-acl'.

** Emacs can now be compiled with file notification support.
This happens by default if a suitable system library is found at
build time.  To prevent this, use the configure option
`--with-file-notification-no'.  See below for file-notify features.
FIXME?  This feature is not available for the Nextstep port. (?)

** The configure option `--without-compress-info' has been generalized,
and renamed to `--without-compress-install'.  It now prevents compression
of _any_ files during installation.

** The configure option `--with-crt-dir' has been removed.
It is no longer needed, as the crt*.o files are no longer linked
specially.

** Directories passed to configure option `--enable-locallisppath' are
no longer created during installation.

** Emacs can be compiled with zlib support.
If this library is present (which it normally is on most systems), the
function `zlib-decompress-region' becomes available, which can
decompress gzip- and zlib-format compressed data.

---
** Emacs for NS (OSX, GNUStep) can be built with ImageMagick support.
pkg-config is required to find ImageMagick libraries.

** For OSX >= 10.5, the Core text based font backend from the Mac port is used.
For GNUStep and OSX 10.4 the old backend is used.
To use the old backend by default, do on the command line:
% defaults write org.gnu.Emacs FontBackend ns


* Startup Changes in Emacs 24.4

+++
** When initializing `load-path', an empty element in the EMACSLOADPATH
environment variable (either leading, e.g., ":/foo"; trailing, e.g.,
"/foo:"; or embedded, e.g., "/foo::/bar") is replaced with the default
load-path (the one that would have been used if EMACSLOADPATH was unset).
This makes it easier to _extend_ the load-path via EMACSLOADPATH
(previously, EMACSLOADPATH had to specify the complete load-path,
including the defaults).  (In older versions of Emacs, an empty element
was replaced by ".", so use an explicit "." now if that is what you want.)

+++
** The -L option, which normally prepends its argument to load-path,
will instead append, if the argument begins with `:' (or `;' on MS Windows;
i.e., `path-separator').

+++
** If you use either site-load.el or site-init.el to customize the dumped
Emacs executable, any changes to `load-path' that these files make
will no longer be present after dumping.  To affect a permanent change
to `load-path', use the `--enable-locallisppath' option of `configure'.

+++
** The user option `initial-buffer-choice' can now specify a function
to set up the initial buffer.


* Changes in Emacs 24.4

+++
** New option `gnutls-verify-error', if non-nil, means that Emacs
should reject SSL/TLS certificates that GnuTLS determines as invalid.
(This option defaults to nil at present, but this is expected to change
in a future release.)

+++
** Emacs now supports menus on text-mode terminals.
If the terminal supports a mouse, clicking on the menu bar, or on
sensitive portions of the mode line or header line, will drop down the
menu defined at that position.  Likewise, clicking C-mouse-2 or
C-mouse-2 or C-mouse-3 on the text area will pop up the menus defined
for those locations.

If the text terminal does not support a mouse, you can activate the
first menu-bar menu by typing F10, which invokes `menu-bar-open'.

If you want the previous behavior, whereby F10 invoked `tmm-menubar',
customize the option `tty-menu-open-use-tmm' to a non-nil value.
(Typing M-` will always invoke `tmm-menubar', even if
`tty-menu-open-use-tmm' is nil.)

+++
** The *Messages* buffer is created in `messages-buffer-mode',
a new major mode, with read-only status.  Any code that might create
the *Messages* buffer should call the function `messages-buffer' to do
so and set up the mode.

** Emacs now supports ACLs (access control lists).
+++
*** Emacs preserves the ACL entries of files when backing up.
+++
*** New functions `file-acl' and `set-file-acl' get and set the ACL
entries of a file.  On GNU/Linux, the POSIX ACL interface is used via
libacl.  On MS-Windows, the NT Security APIs are used to emulate the
POSIX ACL interfaces.

** Multi-monitor support has been added.

*** New functions `display-monitor-attributes-list' and
`frame-monitor-attributes' can be used to obtain information about
each physical monitor on multi-monitor setups.

*** The functions `display-pixel-width' and `display-pixel-height' now
behave consistently among the platforms: they return the pixel width
or height for all physical monitors associated with the given display
as just they were on X11.  To get information for each physical
monitor, use the new functions above.  Similar notes also apply to
`x-display-pixel-width', `x-display-pixel-height', `display-mm-width',
`display-mm-height', `x-display-mm-width', and `x-display-mm-height'.

+++
** The cursor stops blinking after 10 blinks (by default) on X and NS.
You can change the default by customizing `blink-cursor-blinks'.

+++
** In keymaps where SPC scrolls forward, S-SPC now scrolls backward.
This affects View mode, etc.

** Help changes

+++
*** The command `apropos-variable' is renamed to `apropos-user-option'.
`apropos-user-option' shows all user options while `apropos-variable'
shows all variables.  When called with a universal prefix argument,
the two commands swap their behaviors.  When `apropos-do-all' is
non-nil, they output the same results.

+++
*** The key `?' now describes prefix bindings, like `C-h'.

*** The command `quail-help' is deleted.  Use `C-h C-\'
(`describe-input-method') instead.

** ImageMagick

*** ImageMagick images now support the :max-width and :max-height
keywords.

*** Some data types aren't auto-detected by ImageMagick.  Adding
:format to `create-image' may help if the content type is in the
new variable `image-format-suffixes'.

** Frame and window changes

+++
*** New commands `toggle-frame-fullscreen' and `toggle-frame-maximized',
bound to <f11> and M-<f10>, respectively.

*** New command `frameset-to-register' is now bound to `C-x r f', replacing
`frame-configuration-to-register'.  It offers similar functionality,
plus enhancements like the ability to restore deleted frames.  The
command `frame-configuration-to-register' still exists, but is unbound.

+++
*** New hooks `focus-in-hook', `focus-out-hook'.
These are normal hooks run when an Emacs frame gains or loses input focus.

---
*** `split-window' is now a non-interactive function, not a command.
As a command, it was a special case of `C-x 2' (`split-window-below'),
and as such superfluous.  After being reimplemented in Lisp, its
interactive form was mistakenly retained.

+++
*** New option `scroll-bar-adjust-thumb-portion'.
Available only on X, this option allows to control over-scrolling
using the scroll bar (i.e. dragging the thumb down even when the end
of the buffer is visible).

** Lisp evaluation changes
+++
*** `eval-defun' on an already defined defcustom calls the :set function,
if there is one.

*** A zero prefix arg of `eval-last-sexp' (`C-x C-e'),
`eval-expression' (`M-:') and `eval-print-last-sexp' (`C-j') inserts
a list with no limit on its length and level (by using nil values of
`print-length' and `print-level'), and inserts additional formats for
integers (octal, hexadecimal, and character).

---
** `write-region-inhibit-fsync' now defaults to t in batch mode.

+++
** `cache-long-line-scans' has been renamed to `cache-long-scans'
because it affects caching of paragraph scanning results as well.

---
** The option `set-mark-default-inactive' has been deleted.
This unfinished feature was introduced by accident in Emacs 23.1;
simply disabling Transient Mark mode does the same thing.

** The default value of `comment-use-global-state' is changed to t,
and this variable has been marked obsolete.

** New user options:

*** `read-regexp-defaults-function' defines a function to read regexps,
used by commands like `rgrep', `lgrep' `occur', `highlight-regexp',
etc.  You can customize this to specify a function that provides a
default value from the regexp last history element, or from the symbol
found at point.

*** `load-prefer-newer', affects how the `load' function chooses the
file to load.  If this is non-nil, then when both .el and .elc
versions of a file exist, and the caller did not explicitly specify
which one to load, then the newer file is loaded.  The default, nil,
means to always load the .elc file.


* Editing Changes in Emacs 24.4

** Indentation changes

+++
*** The behavior of `C-x TAB' (`indent-rigidly') has changed.
When invoked without a prefix argument, it now activates a transient
mode in which typing <left>, <right>, <S-left>, and <S-right> adjusts
the text indentation in the region.  Typing any other key resumes
normal editing behavior.

*** `electric-indent-mode' is enabled by default.

*** `tab-stop-list' is now implicitly extended to infinity by repeating
the last step.  Its default value is changed to nil which means a tab
stop every `tab-width' columns.

** Filling changes

*** New command `cycle-spacing' cycles between spacing conventions:
having just one space, no spaces, or reverting to the original
spacing.  Like `just-one-space', it can handle or ignore newlines and
leave different number of spaces.

*** `fill-single-char-nobreak-p' prevents fill from breaking a line after
a 1-letter word, which is an error according to Polish and
Czech typography rules.  To globally enable this feature, evaluate:

  (add-hook 'fill-nobreak-predicate 'fill-single-char-nobreak-p)

+++
** Uniquify is enabled by default with `post-forward-angle-brackets' style.

** New command `C-x SPC' (`rectangle-mark-mode') makes a rectangular region.
Most commands are still unaware of it, but kill/yank do work on the rectangle.

+++
** New option `visual-order-cursor-movement'.
If this is non-nil, cursor motion with arrow keys will follow the
visual order of characters on the screen: <left> always moves to the
left, <right> always moves to the right, disregarding the surrounding
bidirectional context.

** Register changes

*** All register commands can now show help with preview.

+++
*** New command `C-x C-k x' (`kmacro-to-register') stores keyboard
macros in registers.

*** New command `C-x r f' (`frameset-to-register').
See Changes in Emacs 24.4, above.

** New command `delete-duplicate-lines'.
When its arg ADJACENT is non-nil (when called interactively with C-u
C-u) it works like the utility `uniq'.  Otherwise by default it
deletes duplicate lines everywhere in the region without regard to
adjacency.  When its arg KEEP-BLANKS is non-nil (when called
interactively with C-u C-u C-u), duplicate blank lines are preserved.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 24.4

** More packages look for ~/.emacs.d/<foo> additionally to ~/.<foo>.
Affected files:
~/.emacs.d/timelog	replaces  ~/.timelog
~/.emacs.d/vip		replaces  ~/.vip
~/.emacs.d/viper	replaces  ~/.viper
~/.emacs.d/ido.last	replaces  ~/.ido.last
~/.emacs.d/kkcrc	replaces  ~/.kkcrc
~/.emacs.d/quickurls	replaces  ~/.quickurls
~/.emacs.d/idlwave	replaces  ~/.idlwave
~/.emacs.d/bdfcache.el	replaces  ~/.bdfcache.el
~/.emacs.d/places	replaces  ~/.emacs-places
~/.emacs.d/shadows	replaces  ~/.shadows
~/.emacs.d/shadow_todo	replaces  ~/.shadow_todo
~/.emacs.d/strokes	replaces  ~/.strokes
~/.emacs.d/notes	replaces  ~/.notes
~/.emacs.d/type-break	replaces  ~/.type-break
Also the following files used by the now obsolete otodo-mode.el:
~/.emacs.d/todo-do	replaces  ~/.todo-do
~/.emacs.d/todo-done	replaces  ~/.todo-done
~/.emacs.d/todo-top	replaces  ~/.todo-top

** Backtrace and debugger

*** The Lisp debugger's `e' command now includes the lexical environment
when evaluating the code in the context at point.  Hence, it now lets
you access lexical variables.

+++
*** New command `v' (`debugger-toggle-locals') displays local vars.

*** New minor mode `jit-lock-debug-mode' lets you use the debuggers on
code run via JIT Lock.

** Battery

---
*** Battery information via the BSD `apm' utility is now supported.

** Buffer Menu

*** `M-s a C-o' shows lines matching a regexp in marked buffers using Occur.

** Calendar and Diary

---
*** New faces `calendar-weekday-header', `calendar-weekend-header',
and `calendar-month-header'.

*** New option `calendar-day-header-array'.

+++
*** New variable `diary-from-outlook-function', used by the command
`diary-from-outlook'.

*** The variable `calendar-font-lock-keywords' is obsolete.

** Calc

*** Calc by default now uses the Gregorian calendar for all dates, and
uses January 1, 1 AD as its day number 1.  Previously Calc used the
Julian calendar for dates before September 14, 1752, and it used
December 31, 1 BC as its day number 1; the new scheme is more
consistent with Calendar's calendrical system and day numbering.

*** The new variable `calc-gregorian-switch' lets you configure the
date when Calc switches from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar.
Nil, the default value, means to always use the Gregorian calendar.
The value (YEAR MONTH DAY) means to start using the Gregorian calendar
on the given date.

*** Support for ISO 8601 dates.

** CEDET

*** EDE

**** The cpp-root project now supports executing a compile command.
It can be set through the new :compile-command slot or the
buffer-local variable `compile-command'.

**** Better selection of include directories for the 'linux' project.
Include directories now support out-of-tree build directories and
target architecture auto-detection.

*** Semantic

**** Improved detection of used namespaces in current scope in C++.

**** Parsing of default values for variables and function arguments in C/C++.
They are also displayed by the summarize feature in the modeline.

**** Improved parsing of function pointers in C/C++.
This also includes parsing of function pointers as function arguments.

**** Parsing of C/C++ preprocessor macros which open new scope.
For example, this enables parsing of macros which open new namespaces.

**** Support for 'this' pointer in inline member functions in C++.

** cl-lib

*** New macro `cl-tagbody'.

+++
*** letf is now just an alias for cl-letf.

** CUA mode

*** CUA mode now uses `delete-selection-mode' and `shift-select-mode'.
Hence, you can now enable it independently from `transient-mark-mode',
`delete-selection-mode', and `shift-select-mode'.

*** `cua-highlight-region-shift-only' is now obsolete.
You can disable `transient-mark-mode' to get the same result.

*** CUA's rectangles can now be used via `cua-rectangle-mark-mode'.

** CFEngine mode

*** Support for completion, ElDoc, and Flycheck has been added.

*** The current CFEngine syntax is parsed from "cf-promises -s json".
There is a fallback syntax available if you don't have cf-promises or
if it doesn't support that option.

** Delete Selection mode can now be used without `transient-mark-mode'.

** Desktop

*** `desktop-auto-save-timeout' defines the number of seconds idle time
before auto-save of the desktop.

*** `desktop-restore-frames', enabled by default, allows saving and
restoring the frame/window configuration (frameset).  Additional options
`desktop-restore-in-current-display', `desktop-restore-reuses-frames'
and `desktop-restore-forces-onscreen' offer further customization.

** Dired

*** New minor mode `dired-hide-details-mode' hides details.

** Eldoc Mode works properly in the minibuffer.

** Electric Pair mode
*** New `electric-pair-preserve-balance' enabled by default.

Pairing/skipping only kicks in when that help the balance of
parentheses and quotes, i.e. the buffer should end up at least as
balanced as before.

You can further control this behaviour by adjusting the predicates
stored in `electric-pair-inhibit-predicate' and
`electric-pair-skip-self'.

*** New `electric-pair-delete-adjacent-pairs' enabled by default.

In `electric-pair-mode', the commands `backward-delete-char' and
`backward-delete-char-untabify' are now bound to electric variants
that delete the closer when invoked between adjacent pairs.

*** New `electric-pair-open-newline-between-pairs' enabled by default.

In `electric-pair-mode', inserting a newline between adjacent pairs
opens an extra newline after point, which is indented if
`electric-indent-mode' is also set.

*** New `electric-pair-skip-whitespace' enabled by default.

Controls if skipping over closing delimiters should jump over any
whitespace slack. Setting it to `chomp' makes it delete this
whitespace. See also the variable
`electric-pair-skip-whitespace-chars'.

*** New variables control the pairing in strings and comments.

You can customize `electric-pair-text-pairs' and
`electric-pair-text-syntax-table' to tweak pairing behaviour inside
strings and comments.

** EPA

*** New option `epa-mail-aliases'.

You can set this to a list of alias expansions for keys to use
in `epa-mail-encrypt'.

If one element of the variable's value is ("foo@bar.com" "foo@hello.org"),
that means: when one of the recipients of the message being encrypted
is `foo@bar.com', encrypt the message for `foo@hello.org' instead.

If one element of the variable's value is ("foo@bar.com"),
that means: when one of the recipients of the message being encrypted
is `foo@bar.com', ignore that name as regards encryption.
This is useful to avoid a query when you have no key for that name.

** ERC

*** New option `erc-accidental-paste-threshold-seconds'.
If set to a number, this can be used to avoid accidentally paste large
amounts of data into the ERC input.

+++
** ERT

*** New macro `skip-unless' allows skipping ERT tests.
See the ERT manual for details.

** Eshell

+++
*** `eshell' now supports visual subcommands and options
Eshell has been able to handle "visual" commands (interactive,
non-line oriented commands such as top that require display
capabilities not provided by eshell) by running them in an Emacs
terminal emulator.  See `eshell-visual-commands'.

This feature has been extended to subcommands and options that make a
usually line-oriented command a visual command.  Typical examples are
"git log" and "git <command> --help" which display their output in a
pager by default.  See `eshell-visual-subcommands' and
`eshell-visual-options'.

---
*** Added Eshell-Tramp module
External su and sudo commands are now the default; the internal,
Tramp-using variants can still be used by enabling the eshell-tramp
module.

** F90 mode
---
*** New option `f90-smart-end-names'.

** Icomplete is a bit more like Ido.

*** key bindings to navigate through and select the completions.

*** The icomplete-separator is customizable, and its default has changed.

*** Removed icomplete-show-key-bindings.

*** Icomplete-mode by defaults applies to all forms of minibuffer completion.
(setq icomplete-with-completion-tables '(internal-complete-buffer))
will revert to the old behavior.

** Ido

*** Ido has a manual now.

*** `ido-use-virtual-buffers' takes a new value 'auto.

*** `ido-decorations' has been slightly extended to give a bit more control.

** Image mode

+++
*** New commands `n' (`image-next-file') and `p' (`image-previous-file')
visit the next image file and the previous image file in the same
directory, respectively.

*** New commands to show specific frames of multi-frame images.
`f' (`image-next-frame') and `b' (`image-previous-frame') visit the
next or previous frame.  `F' (`image-goto-frame') shows a specific frame.

*** New commands to speed up, slow down, or reverse animation.
---
*** The command `image-mode-fit-frame' deletes other windows.
When toggling, it restores the frame's previous window configuration.
It also has an optional frame argument, which can be used by Lisp
callers to fit the image to a frame other than the selected frame.

** Hi-Lock

*** New option `hi-lock-auto-select-face'.  When non-nil, hi-lock commands
will cycle through faces in `hi-lock-face-defaults' without prompting.

+++
*** New global command `M-s h .' (`highlight-symbol-at-point')
highlights the symbol found near point without prompting,
using the next face automatically.

** Imenu

*** New option `imenu-generic-skip-comments-and-strings'.

** Info
---
*** New face `info-index-match' is used to highlight matches in index
entries displayed by `Info-index-next', `Info-virtual-index' and
`info-apropos'.

** JS Mode

*** Better indentation of multiple-variable declarations.
If declaration spans several lines, variables on the following lines
are lined up to the first one.

*** We now recognize and better indent continuations in array
comprehensions.

*** New option `js-switch-indent-offset`.

** MH-E has been updated to MH-E version 8.5.
See MH-E-NEWS for details.

+++
** Octave mode
*** Font locking for texinfo comments and new keywords
*** Completion in Octave file buffers
*** Eldoc support
*** Jump to definition
*** Documentation lookup/search
*** Code cleanup and various bug fixes

** OPascal mode is the new name for Delphi mode.

*** All delphi-* variables and functions have been renamed to opascal-*.
*** `delphi-newline-always-indents' is not supported any more.
Use `electric-indent-mode' instead.
*** `delphi-tab' is gone, replaced by `indent-for-tab-command'.

** Package

*** The format of `archive-contents' files, generated by package
repositories, has changed to allow a new (fifth) element in the data
vectors, containing an associative list with extra properties.

*** `describe-package' buffer uses the `:url' extra property to
display a `Homepage' header, if it's present.

*** In the buffer produced by `describe-package', there are now buttons
listing the keywords related to that package.  You can click on them
to see other packages related to any given keyword.

*** In the *Packages* buffer, `f' or the Package->Filter menu filters
the packages by a keyword.

** Prolog mode

*** `prolog-use-smie' has been removed, along with the non-SMIE
indentation code.

** Remember

*** The new command `remember-notes' creates a buffer which is saved
on `kill-emacs'.

You may think of it as a *scratch* buffer whose content is preserved.
In fact, it was designed as a replacement for *scratch* buffer and can
be used that way by setting `initial-buffer-choice' to
`remember-notes' and `remember-notes-buffer-name' to "*scratch*".
Without the second change, *scratch* buffer will still be there for
notes that do not need to be preserved.

*** The Remember package can now store notes in separates files.
You can use the new function `remember-store-in-files' within the
`remember-handler-functions' option.

See `remember-data-directory' and `remember-directory-file-name-format'
for new options related to this function.

** Rmail

*** Customize `rmail-mbox-format' to influence some minor aspects of
how Rmail displays non-MIME messages.

---
*** The `unrmail' command now converts from BABYL to mboxrd format,
rather than mboxo.  Customize `unrmail-mbox-format' to change this.

** Ruby mode

*** New option `ruby-encoding-magic-comment-style'.

*** New option `ruby-custom-encoding-magic-comment-template'.

*** New mode menu.

*** Improved syntax highlighting and indentation.

*** Add more Ruby file types to `auto-mode-alist'.

*** New option `ruby-align-to-stmt-keywords'.

*** New `electric-indent-mode' integration.

** Search and Replace

+++
*** New global command `M-s .' (`isearch-forward-symbol-at-point')
starts a symbol (identifier) incremental search forward with the
symbol found near point added to the search string initially.

*** `C-x 8 RET' in Isearch mode reads a character by its Unicode name
and adds it to the search string.

*** `M-s i' in Isearch mode toggles the variable `isearch-invisible'
between nil and the value of the option `search-invisible' (or `open'
when it's nil).

*** `query-replace' skips invisible text when `search-invisible' is nil,
and opens overlays with hidden text when `search-invisible' is `open'.

+++
*** A negative prefix arg of replacement commands replaces backward.
`M-- M-%' replaces a string backward, `M-- C-M-%' replaces a regexp
backward, `M-s w words M-- M-%' replaces a sequence of words backward.

+++
*** By default, prefix arguments do not now terminate Isearch mode.
Set `isearch-allow-prefix' to nil to restore old behavior.

*** More Isearch commands accept prefix arguments, namely
`isearch-printing-char', `isearch-quote-char', `isearch-yank-word',
`isearch-yank-line'.

*** Word search now matches whitespace at the beginning/end
of the search string if it contains leading/trailing whitespace.
In an incremental word search or when using a non-nil LAX argument
of `word-search-regexp', the lax matching can also match part of
the first word (in addition to the lax matching of the last word).
The same rules are now applied to the symbol search with the difference
that it matches symbols, and non-symbol characters between symbols.

+++
** SES

*** New command `ses-rename-cell' allows assigning names to SES cells.

** Shell

*** `explicit-bash-args' now always defaults to use --noediting.
During initialization, Emacs no longer expends a process to decide
whether it is safe to use Bash's --noediting option.  These days
--noediting is ubiquitous; it was introduced in 1996 in Bash version 2.

** Shell Script mode

*** `sh-mode' now has the mode own `add-log-current-defun-function'.
You can pick the name of the function and the variables with `C-x 4 a'.

*** The SMIE indentation engine is now used by default.

** SMIE indentation can be customized via `smie-config'.
The customization can be guessed by Emacs by providing a sample indented
file and letting SMIE learn from it.

** Term mode

*** New option `term-suppress-hard-newline'.

** Todo mode has been rewritten and enhanced.
New features include:
- support for multiple todo files and archive files of done items;
- renaming, reordering, moving, merging, and deleting categories;
- sortable tabular summaries of categories and the types of items they contain;
- cross-category lists of items filtered by specific criteria;
- more fine-grained interaction with the Emacs diary, by being able to decide
  for each todo item whether it appears in the Fancy Diary display;
- highly flexible new item insertion and item editing;
- moving items between categories, storing done items in their category or in
  archive files, undoing or unarchiving done items;
- reprioritizing items by inputting a numerical priority;
- extensive customizability of operation and display, including numerous faces.
The Todo mode user manual describes all commands and most user options.
To support some of these features, a new file format is used, which is
incompatible with the old format; however, you can convert old todo and done
item files to the new format on initializing the first new todo file, or at any
later time with the provided conversion command.  The old version of
todo-mode.el has been made obsolete and renamed otodo-mode.el.

** trace-function was largely rewritten.
New features include:
- no prompting for the destination buffer, unless a prefix-arg was used.
- additionally to prompting for a destination buffer, when a prefix-arg is
  used, the user can enter a "context", i.e. Lisp expression whose value at the
  time the function is entered/exited will be printed along with the function
  name and arguments.  Useful to trace the value of (current-buffer) or
  (point) when the function is invoked.

** Tramp

*** The experimental url syntax for remote file names is withdrawn.

+++
*** New connection method "adb", which allows to access Android
devices by the Android Debug Bridge.  The variable `tramp-adb-program'
can be used to adapt the path of the "adb" program, if needed.

*** The connection methods "plink1", "ssh1", "ssh2", "scp1", "scp2",
"scpc" and "rsyncc" are discontinued.  The ssh option
"ControlMaster=auto" is set automatically in all ssh-based methods,
when possible.

+++
*** Handlers for `file-acl' and `set-file-acl' for remote machines
which support POSIX ACLs.

+++
*** Handlers for `file-notify-add-watch' and `file-notify-rm-watch'
for remote machines which support filesystem notifications.

** New command `url-cookie-list' displays all the current cookies, and
allows deleting selected cookies.

** VC and related modes

+++
*** In VC directory mode, `D' displays diffs between VC-controlled
whole tree revisions.

+++
*** In VC directory mode, `L' lists the change log for the current VC
controlled tree in a window.

+++
*** In VC directory mode, `I' shows a log of changes that will be
received with a pull operation.

+++
*** `C-x v G' (globally) and `G' (in VC directory mode) ignores a file
under current version control system.  When called with a prefix
argument, you can remove a file from the ignored file list.

---
*** `cvs-append-to-ignore' has been renamed to `vc-cvs-append-to-ignore'
because it is moved to vc-cvs.el.

** VHDL mode

*** New options: `vhdl-actual-generic-name', `vhdl-beautify-options'.

*** New commands: `vhdl-fix-statement-region', `vhdl-fix-statement-buffer'.

** Woman

*** The commands `woman-default-faces' and `woman-monochrome-faces'
are obsolete.  Customize the `woman-*' faces instead.

** Obsolete packages:

*** Iswitchb is made obsolete by icomplete-mode.

*** longlines.el is obsolete; use visual-line-mode instead.

+++
*** sup-mouse.el.

*** terminal.el is obsolete; use term.el instead.

*** The previous version of todo-mode.el is obsolete and renamed otodo-mode.el.

*** xesam.el.

+++
*** yow.el is obsolete; use fortune.el or cookie1.el instead.

---
*** The Info-edit command is obsolete.  Editing Info nodes by hand
has not been relevant for some time.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 24.4

** New package `eww' is a built-in web browser.
It is only available if Emacs is compiled with libxml2 support.

** New minor mode `superword-mode', defined in subword.el
`superword-mode' overrides the default word motion commands to treat
symbol_words as a single word, similar to what `subword-mode' does and
using the same internal functions.

** New package nadvice.el offers lighter-weight advice facilities.
It is layered as:
- add-function/remove-function which can be used to add/remove code on any
  function-carrying place, such as process-filters or `<foo>-function' hooks.
- advice-add/advice-remove to add/remove a piece of advice on a named function,
  much like `defadvice' does.

** New package frameset.el.
It provides a set of operations to save a frameset (the state of all
or a subset of the existing frames and windows, somewhat similar to a
frame configuration), both in-session and persistently, and restore it
at some point in the future.

+++
** New package filenotify.el provides an interface for file system
notifications.  It requires that Emacs be compiled with one of the
low-level libraries gfilenotify.c, inotify.c or w32notify.c.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 24.4

---
** `kill-region' lost its `yank-handler' optional argument.

+++
** `(input-pending-p)' no longer runs other timers which are ready to
run.  The new optional CHECK-TIMERS param allows for the prior behavior.

** `defvar' and `defcustom' in a let-binding affect the "external" default.

---
** The syntax of ?» and ?« is now punctuation instead of matched parens.
Some languages match those as »...« and others as «...» so better stay neutral.

---
** In compiled Lisp files, the header no longer includes a timestamp.

+++
** The default file coding for Emacs Lisp files is now utf-8.
(See `file-coding-system-alist'.)  In most cases, this change is
transparent, but files that contain unusual characters without
specifying an explicit coding system may fail to load with obscure
errors.  You should either convert them to utf-8 or add an explicit
`coding:' cookie.

+++
** `overriding-terminal-local-map' no longer replaces the local keymaps.
It used to disable the minor mode, major mode, and text-property keymaps,
whereas now it simply has higher precedence.

** Default process filters and sentinels are not nil any more.
Instead they default to a function which does what the nil value used to do.

+++
** `read-event' does not return decoded chars in ttys any more.
As was the case in Emacs 22 and before, the decoding of terminal
input, according to `keyboard-coding-system', is not performed in
`read-event' any more.  But unlike in Emacs 22, this decoding is still
done before input-decode-map, function-key-map, etc.

---
** Removed `inhibit-local-menu-bar-menus'.

---
** Frame-local variables that affect redisplay do not work any more.
More specifically, the redisplay does not bother to check for a frame-local
value when looking up variables.

+++
** nil and "unbound" are indistinguishable in `symbol-function'.
`symbol-function' does not signal a `void-function' error any more.
To determine if a symbol's function definition is void, use `fboundp'.

+++
** `defadvice' does not honor the `freeze' flag and cannot advise
special-forms any more.

---
** `dolist' no longer binds VAR while evaluating the RESULT form,
when lexical binding is enabled.  Previously, VAR was bound to nil,
which often led to spurious unused-variable warnings.

** The return value of `backup-buffer' has changed.
The second argument is no longer an SELinux context, instead it is an
alist of extended attributes as returned by the new function
`file-extended-attributes'.  The attributes can be applied to another
file using `set-file-extended-attributes'.

** By default `copy-file' no longer copies file permission bits to an
existing destination; and it sets the file permission bits of a newly
created destination to those of the source, masked by the default file
permissions.  To copy the file permission bits, pass t as the
PRESERVE-PERMISSIONS argument of `copy-file'.

+++
** `visited-file-modtime' now returns -1 for nonexistent files.
Formerly it returned a list (-1 LOW USEC PSEC), but this was ambiguous
in the presence of files with negative time stamps.

+++
** The cars of the elements in `interpreter-mode-alist' are now
treated as regexps rather than literal strings.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 24.4

+++
** The second argument of `eval' can now specify a lexical environment.

+++
** New functions `special-form-p' and `macrop'.

** New macro `define-alternatives' can be used to define generic commands.
Generic commands are interactive functions whose implementation can be
selected among several alternatives, as a matter of user preference.

** The `defalias-fset-function' property lets you catch `defalias'
calls, and redirect them to your own function, instead of `fset'.

** Docstrings can be made dynamic by adding a `dynamic-docstring-function'
text-property on the first char.

+++
** New variable `enable-dir-local-variables'.
Directory-local variables are ignored if this is nil.  This may be
useful for modes that want to ignore directory-locals while still
respecting file-local variables.

+++
** New function `get-pos-property'.

** Completion changes

*** The separator for `completing-read-multiple' can now be a regexp.
The default separator has been changed to allow surrounding spaces
around the comma.

*** The `common-substring' arg of `display-completion-list' is obsolete.
Either use `completion-all-completions', which returns highlighted
strings (including for partial or substring completion), or call
`completion-hilit-commonality' to add the highlight.

** New minor modes `prettify-symbols-mode' and `global-prettify-symbols-mode'
let you enable symbol prettification (replacing a string like "lambda" with
the Greek lambda character).

** Terminal changes

+++
*** Functions to pop up menus and dialogs now work on all terminals,
including TTYs.  This includes `x-popup-menu', `x-popup-dialog',
`message-box', `yes-or-no-p', etc.

The function `display-popup-menus-p' will now return non-nil for a
display or frame whenever a mouse is supported on that display or
frame.

*** New hook `tty-setup-hook'.

** Window Handling

*** New display action function `display-buffer-no-window' to not
display the buffer in a window.

*** New display action alist entry `allow-no-window' to indicate the
caller of `display-buffer' is ready to handle the case of not
displaying the buffer in a window.

** New hook `pre-redisplay-function'.

+++
** New bool-vector set operation functions:
*** `bool-vector-exclusive-or'
*** `bool-vector-union'
*** `bool-vector-intersection'
*** `bool-vector-set-difference'
*** `bool-vector-not'
*** `bool-vector-subsetp'
*** `bool-vector-count-consecutive'
*** `bool-vector-count-population'

+++
** Comparison functions =, <, >, <=, >= now take many arguments.

** Error-handling changes

+++
*** New function `define-error'.

*** `with-demoted-errors' takes an additional argument `format'.

+++
** New macro with-eval-after-load.  Like eval-after-load, but better behaved.

** New library subr-x.el for misc helper functions
+++
*** `hash-table-keys'
+++
*** `hash-table-values'

*** `string-blank-p`
*** `string-empty-p`
*** `string-join`
*** `string-reverse`
*** `string-trim-left'
*** `string-trim-right'
*** `string-trim'
*** `string-remove-prefix'
*** `string-remove-suffix'

** Obsoleted functions:
*** `log10'
*** `dont-compile'
*** `lisp-complete-symbol'
*** `field-complete'
*** `minibuffer-completion-contents'
*** `isearch-nonincremental-exit-minibuffer'
*** `isearch-filter-visible'
*** `generic-make-keywords-list'
*** `get-upcase-table' (use `case-table-get-table' instead).

** `with-wrapper-hook' is obsoleted by `add-function'.
The few hooks that used with-wrapper-hook are replaced as follows:
*** `abbrev-expand-function' obsoletes `abbrev-expand-functions'.
*** `completion-in-region-function' obsoletes `completion-in-region-functions'.
*** `filter-buffer-substring-function' obsoletes `filter-buffer-substring-functions'.

** `byte-compile-interactive-only-functions' is now obsolete.
It has been replaced by the symbol property 'interactive-only.

+++
** `split-string' now takes an optional argument TRIM.
The value, if non-nil, is a regexp that specifies what to trim from
the start and end of each substring.

** New function `string-suffix-p'.

** File-handling changes

+++
*** Support for filesystem notifications.
Emacs now supports notifications of filesystem changes, such as
creation, modification, and deletion of files.  This requires the
`glib' API, or the 'inotify' API (on GNU/Linux systems only).  On
MS-Windows systems, this is supported for Windows XP and newer
versions.

+++
*** The 9th element returned by `file-attributes' is now unspecified.
Formerly, it was t if the file's gid would change if file were deleted
and recreated.  This value has been inaccurate for years on many
platforms, and nobody seems to have noticed or cared.

+++
*** The 6th argument to `copy-file' has been renamed to
PRESERVE-PERMISSIONS as it now handles ACL entries and the traditional
Unix file permission bits as well as SELinux context.

+++
*** The function `file-ownership-preserved-p' now has an optional
argument GROUP which causes it check for file group too.  This can be
used in place of the 9th element of `file-attributes'.

*** The function `set-visited-file-modtime' now accepts a 0 or -1
argument, with the same interpretation as the returned value of
`visited-file-modtime'.

** Changes in autorevert.el

---
*** If Emacs is compiled with file notification support, notifications
are used instead of checking the time stamp of the files.  You can
disable this by setting the user option `auto-revert-use-notify' to
nil.  Alternatively, a regular expression of directories to be
excluded from file notifications can be specified by
`auto-revert-notify-exclude-dir-regexp'.

---
*** The new user option `auto-revert-remote-files' enables reversion
of remote files when set to non-nil.

** Face changes

*** The function `face-spec-set' is now like `setq' for face specs.
Its third arg now accepts values specifying a face spec type (defface,
custom, or override spec), and the relevant spec is set accordingly.

+++
*** New function `add-face-text-property', which can be used to
conveniently prepend/append new face properties.

*** Face specs set via Custom themes now replace the `defface' spec
rather than inheriting from it (as do face specs set via Customize).

*** New face characteristic (supports :underline (:style wave))
specifies whether or not the terminal can display a wavy line.

+++
*** New face spec attribute :distant-foreground
specifies foreground to use if background color is near the foreground
color that would otherwise have been used.

** Image API

+++
*** `image-animated-p' is now `image-multi-frame-p'.
It returns non-nil for any image that contains multiple frames,
whether or not it specifies a frame delay.

+++
*** New variable `image-default-frame-delay' gives the frame delay for
animated images which do not specify a frame delay.

+++
*** New functions `image-current-frame' and `image-show-frame' for getting
and setting the current frame of a multi-frame image.

** EIEIO

*** Namespace cleanup by obsolete-aliasing functions to use `eieio-' prefix.
**** object-name -> eieio-object-name
**** object-class -> eieio-object-class
**** object-class-fast -> eieio--object-class
**** object-name-string -> eieio-object-name-string
**** object-num-slots -> eieio--object-num-slots
**** object-set-name-string -> eieio-object-set-name-string
**** class-parent -> eieio-class-parent
**** class-parents -> eieio-class-parents
**** class-children -> eieio-class-children
**** class-num-slots -> eieio--class-num-slots
**** class-precedence-list -> eieio-class-precedence-list
**** All generated class-* and object-* field accessors are now
prefixed with `eieio-' as well.

*** Obsoleted functions:
**** class-of
**** class-direct-subclasses
**** class-direct-superclasses

** Changes in encoding and decoding of text

---
*** New coding-system `prefer-utf-8'.
This is like `undecided' but prefers UTF-8 on decoding if the text to
be decoded does not contain any invalid UTF-8 sequences.  On encoding,
any non-ASCII characters are automatically encoded as UTF-8.

---
*** New attributes of coding-systems whose type is `undecided'.
Two new attributes, `:inhibit-null-byte-detection' and
`:inhibit-iso-escape-detection', determine how to detect encoding of
text that includes null bytes and ISO-2022 escape sequences,
respectively.  Each of these attributes can be either nil, zero, or
t.  If it is t, decoding text ignores null bytes and, respectively,
ISO-2022 sequences.  If it is nil, null bytes cause text to be decoded
with no-conversion and ISO-2022 sequences cause Emacs to assume the
text is encoded in one of the ISO-2022 encodings, such as
iso-2022-7bit.  If the value is zero, Emacs consults the variables
inhibit-null-byte-detection and inhibit-iso-escape-detection, which
see.
The new attribute `:prefer-utf-8', if non-nil, causes Emacs to prefer
UTF-8 encoding and decoding, whenever possible.

These attributes are only meaningful for coding-systems of type
`undecided'.  (The type of a coding-system is determined by its
`:coding-type' attribute and can be accessed by calling the
`coding-system-type' function.)

** `time-to-seconds' is not obsolete any more.

** The lock for 'DIR/FILE' is now 'DIR/.#FILE' and may be a regular file.
When you edit DIR/FILE, Emacs normally creates a symbolic link
DIR/.#FILE as a lock that warns other instances of Emacs that DIR/FILE
is being edited.  Formerly, if there was already a non-symlink file
named DIR/.#FILE, Emacs fell back on the lock names DIR/.#FILE.0
through DIR/.#FILE.9.  These fallbacks have been removed, so that
Emacs now no longer locks DIR/FILE in that case.

On file systems that do not support symbolic links, the lock is now a
regular file with contents being what would have been in the symlink.

+++
** New functions `group-gid' and `group-real-gid'.

** Changes to the Emacs Lisp Coding Conventions in Emacs 24.4

+++
*** The package descriptor and name of global variables, constants,
and functions should be separated by two hyphens if the symbol is not
meant to be used by other packages.


* Changes in Emacs 24.4 on Non-Free Operating Systems

** The procedure for building Emacs on MS-Windows has changed.
It is now built by running the same configure script as on all other
platforms.  This requires the MSYS environment and MinGW development
tools.  See the updated instructions in nt/INSTALL for details.

Using the Posix configure script and Makefile's also means a change in
the directory structure of the Emacs installation on Windows.  It is
now the same as on GNU and Unix systems.  In particular, the auxiliary
programs, such as cmdproxy.exe and hexl.exe, are in
libexec/emacs/VERSION/i686-pc-mingw32 (where VERSION is the Emacs
version), version-independent site-lisp is in share/emacs/site-lisp,
version-specific Lisp files are in share/emacs/VERSION/lisp and in
share/emacs/VERSION/site-lisp, Info docs are in share/info, and data
files are in share/emacs/VERSION/etc.  (Emacs knows about all these
directories and will find the files in there automatically; there's no
need to set any variables due to this change.)

+++
** Emacs on Windows 2000 and later can now access files and directories
whose names cannot be encoded in the current system codepage.

The new variable `w32-unicode-filenames' controls this feature: if it
is t, Emacs uses Unicode APIs to pass file names to system calls,
which lifts the limitation of file names to the current locale.

+++
** The "generate a backtrace on fatal error" feature now works on MS Windows.
The backtrace is written to the 'emacs_backtrace.txt' file in the
directory where Emacs was running.

+++
** The variable `buffer-file-type' is no longer supported.
Setting it has no effect, and %t in the mode-line format is ignored.
Likewise, `file-name-buffer-file-type-alist' is now obsolete, and
modifying it has no effect.

---
** Lock files now work on MS-Windows.
This allows to avoid losing your edits if the same file is being
edited in another Emacs session or by another user.  See the node
"Interlocking" in the Emacs User Manual for the details.  To disable
file locking, customize `create-lockfiles' to nil.

** Improved fullscreen support on Mac OS X.
Both native (>= OSX 10.7) and "old style" fullscreen are supported.
Customize `ns-use-native-fullscreen' to change style.  For >= 10.7
native is the default.

** OSX >= 10.7 can use sRGB colorspace.
Customize `ns-use-srgb-colorspace' to change style.  t is the default.
Note: This does not apply to images.


* Installation Changes in Emacs 24.3

** The default X toolkit is now Gtk+ version 3.
If you don't pass `--with-x-toolkit' to configure, or if you use
`--with-x-toolkit=gtk' or `--with-x-toolkit=yes', configure will try
to build with Gtk+ version 3, and if that fails, try Gtk+ version 2.
You can explicitly require a specific version by passing
`--with-x-toolkit=gtk2' or `--with-x-toolkit=gtk3' to configure.

** New configure option `--enable-link-time-optimization', to utilize
an appropriate feature provided by GCC since version 4.5.0.

** New configure option `--without-all' to disable most of the optional
features (image support, etc.) that are normally enabled by default.

** New configure option `--enable-gcc-warnings' (for developing/debugging
Emacs).  If building with GCC, this enables compile-time checks that
warn/give errors about possibly-questionable C code.  On a recent GNU
system there should be no warnings; on older and on non-GNU systems
the results may be useful to developers.

** The configure option `--enable-use-lisp-union-type' has been
renamed to `--enable-check-lisp-object-type', as the resulting
Lisp_Object type no longer uses a union to implement the compile time
check that this option enables.

** The configure option `--disable-maintainer-mode' has been removed,
as it was confusingly-named and rarely useful.

** The configure options `--program-prefix', `--program-suffix', and
`--program-transform-name' apply to more than just the installed
binaries.  Now they also affect the man pages, icons, and the
etc/emacs.desktop file; but not the info pages, since this would break
links between the various manuals.

** You can use `NO_BIN_LINK=t make install' to prevent the installation
overwriting "emacs" in the installation bin/ directory with a link
to "emacs-VERSION".

** Emacs uses libtinfo in preference to libncurses, if available.

** On FreeBSD and NetBSD, configure no longer adds /usr/local/lib and
/usr/pkg/lib to the linker search path.  You must add them yourself if
you want them.

** The standalone scripts `rcs-checkin' and `vcdiff' have been removed
(from the bin and libexec directories, respectively).  The former is
no longer relevant, the latter is replaced by lisp (in vc-sccs.el).


* Startup Changes in Emacs 24.3

** Emacs no longer searches for `leim-list.el' files beneath the standard
lisp/ directory.  There should not be any there anyway.  If you have
been adding them there, put them somewhere else; e.g., site-lisp.

** The `--no-site-lisp' command line option now works for Nextstep builds.


* Changes in Emacs 24.3

** Help

*** `C-h f' (`describe-function') can now perform autoloading.
When this command is called for an autoloaded function whose docstring
contains a key substitution construct, that function's library is
automatically loaded, so that the documentation can be shown
correctly.  To disable this, set `help-enable-auto-load' to nil.

*** `C-h f' now reports previously-autoloaded functions as "autoloaded",
even after their associated libraries have been loaded (and the
autoloads have been redefined as functions).

** ImageMagick

*** Images displayed via ImageMagick now support transparency and the
:background image specification property.

*** When available, ImageMagick support is automatically enabled.
It is no longer necessary to call `imagemagick-register-types'
explicitly to install ImageMagick image types; that function is called
automatically at startup, or when customizing an imagemagick- option.

*** Setting `imagemagick-types-inhibit' to t now disables the use of
ImageMagick to view images.  (You must call `imagemagick-register-types'
afterwards if you do not use customize to change this.)

*** The new variable `imagemagick-enabled-types' also affects which
ImageMagick types are treated as images.  The function
`imagemagick-filter-types' returns the list of types that will be
treated as images.

** Minibuffer

*** In minibuffer filename prompts, `C-M-f' and `C-M-b' now move to the
next and previous path separator, respectively.

*** `minibuffer-electric-default-mode' can shorten "(default ...)" to "[...]"
in minibuffer prompts.  Just set `minibuffer-eldef-shorten-default'
non-nil before enabling the mode.

** Mode line

*** New option `mode-line-default-help-echo' specifies the help text
(shown in a tooltip or in the echo area) for any part of the mode line
that does not have its own specialized help text.

*** You can now click mouse-3 in the coding system indicator to invoke
`set-buffer-file-coding-system'.

** Server and client

*** emacsclient now obeys string values for `initial-buffer-choice',
if it is told to open a new frame without specifying any file to visit
or expression to evaluate.

*** New option `server-auth-key' specifies a shared server key.

** Emacs now generates backtraces on fatal errors.
On encountering a fatal error, Emacs now outputs a textual description
of the fatal signal, and a short backtrace on platforms like glibc
that support backtraces.

** `C-x C-q' is now bound to the new minor mode `read-only-mode'.
This minor mode replaces `toggle-read-only', which is now obsolete.

** Most `y-or-n' prompts now allow you to scroll the selected window.
Typing `C-v' or `M-v' at a y-or-n prompt scrolls forward or backward
respectively, without exiting from the prompt.

** In the Package Menu, newly-available packages are listed as "new",
and sorted above the other "available" packages by default.

** If your Emacs was built from a bzr checkout, the new variable
`emacs-bzr-version' contains information about the bzr revision used.

** New option `create-lockfiles' specifies usage of lockfiles.
It defaults to t.  Changing it to nil inhibits the creation of lock
files (use this with caution).

** New option `enable-remote-dir-locals', if non-nil, allows directory-local
variables on remote hosts.

** The entry for PCL-CVS has been removed from the Tools menu.
The PCL-CVS commands are still available via the keyboard.

** Using "unibyte: t" in Lisp source files is obsolete.
Use "coding: raw-text" instead.

** In the buffer made by `M-x report-emacs-bug', the `C-c m' binding
has been changed to `C-c M-i' (`report-emacs-bug-insert-to-mailer').
The previous binding, introduced in Emacs 24.1, was a mistake, because
`C-c LETTER' bindings are reserved for user customizations.

** Internationalization

*** New language environment: Persian.

*** New input method `vietnamese-vni'.

** Nextstep (GNUstep / Mac OS X) port

*** Support for fullscreen and the frame parameter fullscreen.

*** A file dialog is used for open/save operations initiated from the
menu/toolbar.


* Editing Changes in Emacs 24.3

** Search and Replace

*** Non-regexp Isearch now performs "lax" space matching.
Each sequence of spaces in the supplied search string may match any
sequence of one or more whitespace characters, as specified by the
variable `search-whitespace-regexp'.  (This variable is also used by a
similar existing feature for regexp Isearch.)

*** New Isearch command `M-s SPC' toggles lax space matching.
This applies to both ordinary and regexp Isearch.

*** New option `replace-lax-whitespace'.
If non-nil, `query-replace' uses flexible whitespace matching too.
The default is nil.

*** Global `M-s _' starts a symbol (identifier) incremental search,
and `M-s _' in Isearch toggles symbol search mode.
`M-s c' in Isearch toggles search case-sensitivity.

** Navigation commands

*** New binding `M-g c' for `goto-char'.

*** New binding `M-g TAB' for `move-to-column'.

*** `M-g TAB' (`move-to-column') prompts for a column number if called
interactively with no prefix arg.  Previously, it moved to column 1.

** New option `yank-handled-properties' allows processing of text
properties on yanked text, in ways that are more general than just
removing them (as is done by `yank-excluded-properties').

** New option `delete-trailing-lines' specifies whether
M-x delete-trailing-whitespace should delete trailing lines at the end
of the buffer.  It defaults to t.

** `C-u M-=' now counts lines/words/characters in the entire buffer.

** `C-x 8 RET' is now bound to `insert-char', which is now a command.
`ucs-insert' is now an obsolete alias for `insert-char'.

** The `z' key no longer has a binding in most special modes.
It used to be bound to `kill-this-buffer', but `z' is too easy to
accidentally type.

** New command `C-x r M-w' (`copy-rectangle-as-kill').
It copies the region-rectangle as the last rectangle kill.

** Registers

*** `C-x r +' is now overloaded to invoke `append-to-register'.

*** New option `register-separator' specifies the register containing
the text to put between collected texts for use with
M-x append-to-register and M-x prepend-to-register.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 24.3

** Common Lisp emulation (CL)

*** CL's main entry is now (require 'cl-lib).
`cl-lib' is like the old `cl' except that it uses the namespace cleanly;
i.e., all its definitions have the "cl-" prefix (and internal definitions
use the "cl--" prefix).

If `cl' provided a feature under the name `foo', then `cl-lib'
provides it under the name `cl-foo' instead; with the exceptions of the
few `cl' definitions that had to use `foo*' to avoid conflicts with
pre-existing Elisp entities.  These have been renamed to `cl-foo'
rather than `cl-foo*'.

The old `cl' is now deprecated and is mainly just a bunch of aliases that
provide the old, non-prefixed names.  Some exceptions are listed below:

*** `cl-flet' is not like `flet' (which is deprecated).
Instead it obeys the behavior of Common-Lisp's `flet'.
In particular, in cl-flet function definitions are lexically scoped,
whereas in flet the scoping is dynamic.

*** `cl-labels' is slightly different from `labels'.
The difference is that it relies on the `lexical-binding' machinery
(as opposed to the `lexical-let' machinery used previously) to capture
definitions in closures, so such closures will only work if `lexical-binding'
is in use.

*** `cl-letf' is not exactly like `letf'.
The only difference is in details that relate to some deprecated usage
of `symbol-function' in place forms.

*** `progv' was rewritten to use the `let' machinery.
A side effect is that variables without corresponding values are bound
to nil rather than being made unbound.

*** The following methods of extending `setf' are obsolete
(use features from gv.el instead):
`define-modify-macro' (use `gv-letplace')
`defsetf' (use `gv-define-simple-setter' or `gv-define-setter')
`define-setf-expander' (use `gv-define-setter' or `gv-define-expander')
`get-setf-method' no longer exists (see "Incompatible Lisp Changes")

** Diff mode

*** Changes are now highlighted using the same color scheme as in
modern VCSes.  Deletions are displayed in red (new faces
`diff-refine-removed' and `smerge-refined-removed', and new definition
of `diff-removed'), insertions in green (new faces `diff-refine-added'
and `smerge-refined-added', and new definition of `diff-added').

*** The variable `diff-use-changed-face' defines whether to use the
face `diff-changed', or `diff-removed' and `diff-added' to highlight
changes in context diffs.

*** The new command `diff-delete-trailing-whitespace' removes trailing
whitespace introduced by a diff.

** Ediff now uses the same color scheme as Diff mode.

** Python mode

A new version of python.el, which provides several new features, including:
per-buffer shells, better indentation, Python 3 support, and improved
shell-interaction compatible with iPython (and virtually any other
text based shell).

*** Some user options have been replaced/renamed, including (old -> new):
**** python-indent -> python-indent-offset
**** python-guess-indent -> python-indent-guess-indent-offset
**** python-pdbtrack-do-tracking-p -> python-pdbtrack-activate
**** python-use-skeletons -> python-skeleton-autoinsert

*** Some user options have been removed, including:

**** `python-indent-string-contents': Strings are never indented.

**** `python-honour-comment-indentation':
Comments are always considered as indentation markers.

**** `python-continuation-offset': Indentation is automatically
calculated in a pep8 compliant way depending on the context.

**** `python-shell-prompt-alist', `python-shell-continuation-prompt-alist':
Have no direct mapping as the shell interaction is completely different.

**** `python-python-command', `python-jython-command':
Replaced by `python-shell-interpreter'.

**** `inferior-python-filter-regexp', `python-remove-cwd-from-path',
`python-pdbtrack-minor-mode-string', `python-source-modes':
No longer relevant.

*** Some commands have been replaced (old -> new):
**** python-insert-class -> python-skeleton-class
**** python-insert-def -> python-skeleton-def
**** python-insert-for -> python-skeleton-for
**** python-insert-if -> python-skeleton-if
**** python-insert-try/except -> python-skeleton-try
**** python-insert-try/finally -> python-skeleton-try
**** python-insert-while -> python-skeleton-while
**** python-find-function -> python-nav-jump-to-defun
**** python-next-statement -> python-nav-forward-sentence
**** python-previous-statement -> python-nav-backward-sentence
**** python-beginning-of-defun-function -> python-nav-beginning-of-defun
**** python-end-of-defun-function -> python-nav-end-of-defun
**** python-send-buffer -> python-shell-send-buffer
**** python-send-defun -> python-shell-send-defun
**** python-send-region -> python-shell-send-region
**** python-send-region-and-go -> emulate with python-shell-send-region
and python-shell-switch-to-shell
**** python-send-string -> python-shell-send-string
**** python-switch-to-python -> python-shell-switch-to-shell
**** python-describe-symbol -> python-eldoc-at-point

** D-Bus

*** New variables `dbus-compiled-version' and `dbus-runtime-version'.

*** The D-Bus object manager interface is implemented.

*** Variables of type :(u)int32 and :(u)int64 accept floating points,
if their value does not fit into Emacs's integer range.

*** The function `dbus-call-method' is now non-blocking.
It can be interrupted by `C-g'.  `dbus-call-method-non-blocking' is obsolete.

*** Signals can also be sent as unicast messages.

*** The argument list of `dbus-register-signal' has been extended,
according to the new match rule types of D-Bus.

*** `dbus-init-bus' supports private connections.

*** There is a new function `dbus-setenv'.

** `desktop-path' no longer includes the "." directory.
Desktop files are now located in ~/.emacs.d by default.

** Dired

*** `dired-do-async-shell-command' executes each file sequentially
if the command ends in `;' (when operating on multiple files).
Otherwise, it executes the command on each file in parallel.

*** Typing `M-n' in the minibuffer of `dired-do-chmod', `dired-do-chgrp',
`dired-do-chown', and `dired-do-touch' yanks the attributes of the
file at point.

*** When the region is active, `m' (`dired-mark'), `u' (`dired-unmark'),
`DEL' (`dired-unmark-backward'), and `d' (`dired-flag-file-deletion')
mark/unmark/flag all files in the active region.

*** The minibuffer default for `=' (`dired-diff') has changed.
It is now the backup file for the file at point, if one exists.
In Transient Mark mode the default is the file at the active mark.

*** `M-=' is no longer bound to `dired-backup-diff' in Dired buffers.
The global binding for `M-=', `count-words-region' is in effect.

** ERC

*** New module "notifications", which can send a notification when you
receive a private message or your nickname is mentioned.

*** ERC will look up server/channel names via auth-source and use any
channel keys found.

*** New option `erc-lurker-hide-list', similar to `erc-hide-list', but
only applies to messages sent by lurkers.

** reStructuredText mode

*** Keybindings (see `C-c C-h'), TAB indentation, filling and auto-filling,
fontification, comment handling, and customization have all been revised
and improved.

*** Support for `imenu' and `which-function-mode'.

*** The reStructuredText syntax is more closely covered.
Sphinx support has been improved.

*** `rst-insert-list' inserts new list or continues existing lists.

*** A negative prefix argument always works for `rst-adjust'.

*** The window configuration is reset after displaying a TOC.

*** The constant `rst-version' describes the rst.el package version.

** Ruby mode

*** Support for percent literals and recognition of regular expressions
in method calls without parentheses with more methods, including Cucumber
steps definitions.

*** Improved syntax highlighting and indentation.

*** New command `ruby-toggle-block', bound to `C-c {'.

*** Some non-standard keybindings/commands have been removed:

**** `ruby-electric-brace'; use `electric-indent-mode' instead.

**** `ruby-mark-defun'; use `mark-defun'.

**** `ruby-beginning-of-defun' and `ruby-end-of-defun' are replaced by
appropriate settings for the variables `beginning-of-defun-function'
and `end-of-defun-function'.

**** Non-standard keybindings for `backward-kill-word', `comment-region',
`reindent-then-newline-and-indent' and `newline' have been removed.

** Shell Script mode

*** Pairing of parens/quotes uses `electric-pair-mode' instead of skeleton-pair.

*** `sh-electric-here-document-mode' now controls auto-insertion of here-docs.

*** `sh-use-smie' lets you choose a new indentation and navigation code.

** VHDL mode

*** The free software compiler GHDL is supported (and now the default).

*** Support for the VHDL-AMS packages has been added/updated.

*** Updated to the 2002 revision of the VHDL standard.

*** Accepts \r and \f as whitespace.

** Apropos

*** The faces used by Apropos are now directly customizable.
These faces are named `apropos-symbol', `apropos-keybinding', and so on;
see the `apropos' Custom group for details.

*** The old options whose values specified faces to use have been removed
(i.e. `apropos-symbol-face', `apropos-keybinding-face', etc.).

** Buffer Menu

*** This package has been rewritten to use Tabulated List mode.

*** Option `Buffer-menu-buffer+size-width' is now obsolete.
Use `Buffer-menu-name-width' and `Buffer-menu-size-width' instead.

** Calc

*** Algebraic simplification mode is now the default.
To restrict to the limited simplifications given by the former
default simplification mode, use `m I'.

** Calendar

*** You can customize the header text that appears above each calendar month.
See the variable `calendar-month-header'.

*** New LaTeX calendar style, produced by `cal-tex-cursor-week2-summary'.

*** The calendars produced by cal-html include holidays.
Customize `cal-html-holidays' to change this.

** CEDET

*** The major modes from the parser generators "Bovine" and "Wisent"
are now properly integrated in Emacs.  The file suffixes ".by" and ".wy"
are in `auto-mode-alist', and the corresponding manuals are included.

*** EDE

**** Menu support for the "Configuration" feature.  This allows users to
choose the active configuration (such as debug or install) from the menu.

**** New command `ede-set' to interactively set project-local variables.

**** Support for compiling, debugging, and running in "generic" projects.

**** Autoconf editing support for M4 macros with complex arguments.

**** Compilation support for the "linux" project type.

**** "simple" projects have been removed; use "generic" projects instead.

*** Semantic

**** Support for parsing #include statements inside a namespace in C/C++.

**** Improved support for 'extern "C"' declarations in C/C++.

**** The ability to ignore more common special C/C++ preprocessor symbols,
such as '__nonnull' and '__asm'.  Add '__cplusplus' macro when parsing C++.
If available, include cdefs.h as an additional source of preprocessor symbols.

**** Improved C/C++ function pointer parsing.

**** In Python, support for converting imports to include file names.

**** Ability to dynamically determine the Python load path.

**** Support for the Python 'WITH' and 'AT' keywords.

**** Improved tooltip completion.

*** SRecode

**** The SRecode manual is now included.

**** Tag generation supports constructor/destructor settings and system
include differentiation.

**** Addition of 'Framework' support: Frameworks are specified when a
particular kind of library (such as Android) is needed in a common language
mode (like Java).

**** Support for nested templates and let variables override based on priority.

**** Support for merging tables from multiple related modes, such as
default -> c++ -> arduino.

** Compile has a new option `compilation-always-kill'.

** Customize

*** `custom-reset-button-menu' now defaults to t.

*** Non-option variables are never matched in `customize-apropos' and
`customize-apropos-options' (i.e., the prefix argument does nothing for
these commands now).

** Term

*** The variables `term-default-fg-color' and `term-default-bg-color'
are now deprecated in favor of the customizable face `term'.

*** You can customize how to display ANSI terminal colors and styles
by customizing the corresponding `term-color-<COLOR>',
`term-color-underline' and `term-color-bold' faces.

** Tramp

*** The syntax has been extended in order to allow ad-hoc proxy definitions.

*** Remote processes are now also supported on remote MS-Windows hosts.

** URL

*** Structs made by `url-generic-parse-url' have nil `attributes' slot.
Previously, this slot stored semicolon-separated attribute-value pairs
appended to some imap URLs, but this is not compatible with RFC 3986.
So now the `filename' slot stores the entire path and query components,
and the `attributes' slot is always nil.

*** New function `url-encode-url' for encoding a URI string.
The `url-retrieve' function now uses this to encode its URL argument,
in case that is not properly encoded.

** notifications.el supports now version 1.2 of the Notifications API.
The function `notifications-get-capabilities' returns the supported
server properties.

** Flymake uses fringe bitmaps to indicate errors and warnings.
See `flymake-fringe-indicator-position', `flymake-error-bitmap' and
`flymake-warning-bitmap'.

** The FFAP option `ffap-url-unwrap-remote' can now be a list of strings,
specifying URL types that should be converted to remote file names at
the FFAP prompt.  The default is now '("ftp").

** New Ibuffer `derived-mode' filter, bound to `/ M'.
The old binding for `/ M' (filter by used-mode) is now bound to `/ m'.

** New option `mouse-avoidance-banish-position' specifies where the
`banish' mouse avoidance setting moves the mouse.

** In Perl mode, new option `perl-indent-parens-as-block' causes non-block
closing brackets to be aligned with the line of the opening bracket.

** In Proced mode, new command `proced-renice' renices marked processes.

** New option `async-shell-command-buffer' specifies the buffer to use
for a new asynchronous `shell-command' when the default output buffer
`*Async Shell Command*' is already in use.

** SQL mode has a new option `sql-db2-escape-newlines'.
If non-nil, newlines sent to the command interpreter will be escaped
by a backslash.  The default does not escape the newlines and assumes
that the sql statement will be terminated by a semicolon.

** New command `tabulated-list-sort', bound to `S' in Tabulated List mode
(and modes that derive from it), sorts the column at point, or the Nth
column if a numeric prefix argument is given.

** `which-func-modes' now defaults to t, so Which Function mode, when
enabled, applies to all applicable major modes.

** `winner-mode-hook' now runs when the mode is disabled, as well as when
it is enabled.

** Follow mode no longer works by using advice.
The option `follow-intercept-processes' has been removed.

** `javascript-generic-mode' is now an obsolete alias for `js-mode'.

** Hooks renamed to avoid obsolete "-hooks" suffix:
*** semantic-lex-reset-hooks -> semantic-lex-reset-functions
*** semantic-change-hooks -> semantic-change-functions
*** semantic-edits-new-change-hooks -> semantic-edits-new-change-functions
*** semantic-edits-delete-change-hooks -> semantic-edits-delete-change-functions
*** semantic-edits-reparse-change-hooks -> semantic-edits-reparse-change-functions
*** semanticdb-save-database-hooks -> semanticdb-save-database-functions
*** c-prepare-bug-report-hooks -> c-prepare-bug-report-hook
*** rcirc-sentinel-hooks -> rcirc-sentinel-functions
*** rcirc-receive-message-hooks -> rcirc-receive-message-functions

*** rcirc-print-hooks -> rcirc-print-functions
*** dbus-event-error-hooks -> dbus-event-error-functions
*** eieio-pre-method-execution-hooks -> eieio-pre-method-execution-functions
*** checkdoc-style-hooks -> checkdoc-style-functions
*** checkdoc-comment-style-hooks -> checkdoc-comment-style-functions
*** archive-extract-hooks -> archive-extract-hook
*** filesets-cache-fill-content-hooks -> filesets-cache-fill-content-hook
*** hfy-post-html-hooks -> hfy-post-html-hook
*** nndiary-request-create-group-hooks -> nndiary-request-create-group-functions
*** nndiary-request-update-info-hooks -> nndiary-request-update-info-functions
*** nndiary-request-accept-article-hooks -> nndiary-request-accept-article-functions
*** gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-hooks -> gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-functions

** Obsolete packages

*** assoc.el
In most cases, assoc+member+push+delq work just as well.
And in any case it's just a terrible package: ugly semantics, terrible
inefficiency, and not namespace-clean.
*** bruce.el
*** cust-print.el
*** ledit.el
*** mailpost.el
*** mouse-sel.el
*** patcomp.el


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 24.3

** Docstrings starting with `*' no longer indicate user options.
Only variables defined using `defcustom' are considered user options.
The function `user-variable-p' is now an obsolete alias for
`custom-variable-p'.

** The return values of `defalias', `defun' and `defmacro' have changed,
and are now undefined.  For backwards compatibility, `defun' and
`defmacro' currently return the name of the newly defined
function/macro, but this should not be relied upon.

** `random' by default now returns a different random sequence in
every Emacs run.  Use `(random S)', where S is a string, to set the
random seed to a value based on S, in order to get a repeatable
sequence in later calls.

** If the NEWTEXT arg to `replace-match' contains a substring "\?",
that substring is inserted literally even if the LITERAL arg is
non-nil, instead of causing an error to be signaled.

** `select-window' now always makes the window's buffer current.
It does so even if the window was selected before.

** The function `x-select-font' can return a font spec, instead of a
font name as a string.  Whether it returns a font spec or a font name
depends on the graphical library.

** `face-spec-set' no longer sets frame-specific attributes when the
third argument is a frame (that usage was obsolete since Emacs 22.2).

** `set-buffer-multibyte' now signals an error in narrowed buffers.

** The CL package's `get-setf-method' function no longer exists.
Generalized variables are now part of core Emacs Lisp, and implemented
differently to the way cl.el used to do it.  It is not possible to
define a compatible replacement for `get-setf-method'.  See the file
gv.el for internal details of the new implementation.

** The arguments of `dbus-register-signal' are no longer just strings,
but keywords or keyword-string pairs.  The old argument list will
still be supported for Emacs 24.x.

** Miscellaneous name changes
Some Lisp symbols have been renamed to correct their spelling,
or to be more consistent with standard Emacs terminology.

*** Renamed functions
**** hangul-input-method-inactivate -> hangul-input-method-deactivate
**** inactivate-input-method -> deactivate-input-method
**** quail-inactivate -> quail-deactivate
**** robin-inactivate -> robin-deactivate
**** viper-inactivate-input-method -> viper-deactivate-input-method
**** viper-inactivate-input-method-action ->
     viper-deactivate-input-method-action
**** ucs-input-inactivate -> ucs-input-deactivate

*** Renamed hooks
The old hooks are still supported for backward compatibility, but they
are deprecated and will be removed eventually.
**** input-method-inactivate-hook -> input-method-deactivate-hook
**** robin-inactivate-hook -> robin-deactivate-hook
**** quail-inactivate-hook -> quail-deactivate-hook

*** Renamed variables
**** follow-deactive-menu -> follow-inactive-menu
**** inactivate-current-input-method-function ->
     deactivate-current-input-method-function

** Some obsolete functions, variables, and faces have been removed:
*** `last-input-char', `last-command-char', `unread-command-char'
*** `facemenu-unlisted-faces'
*** `rmail-decode-mime-charset'
*** `iswitchb-read-buffer'
*** `sc-version', `sc-submit-bug-report'
*** `set-char-table-default'
*** `string-to-sequence' (use `string-to-list' or `string-to-vector')
*** `compile-internal'
*** `modeline'
*** `mode-line-inverse-video'
*** `follow-mode-off-hook'
*** `cvs-commit-buffer-require-final-newline'
(use `log-edit-require-final-newline' instead)
*** `cvs-changelog-full-paragraphs'
(use `log-edit-changelog-full-paragraphs' instead)
*** `cvs-diff-ignore-marks', `cvs-diff-buffer-name'
*** `vc-ignore-vc-files' (use `vc-handled-backends' instead)
*** `vc-master-templates' (use `vc-handled-backends' instead)
*** `vc-checkout-carefully'


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 24.3

** CL-style generalized variables are now in core Elisp.
`setf' is autoloaded; `push' and `pop' accept generalized variables.
You can define your own generalized variables using `gv-define-simple-setter',
`gv-define-setter', etc.

** Emacs tries to macroexpand interpreted (non-compiled) files during load.
This can significantly speed up execution of non-byte-compiled code,
but can also bump into previously unnoticed cyclic dependencies.
These are generally harmless: they will simply cause the macro calls
to be left for later expansion (as before), but will result in a
warning ("Eager macro-expansion skipped due to cycle") describing the cycle.
You may wish to restructure your code so this does not happen.

** New sampling-based Elisp profiler.
Try M-x profiler-start, do some work, and then call M-x profiler-report.
When finished, use M-x profiler-stop.  The sampling rate can be based on
CPU time or memory allocations.

** `defun' also accepts a (declare DECLS) form, like `defmacro'.
The interpretation of the DECLS is determined by `defun-declarations-alist'.

** New macros `setq-local' and `defvar-local'.

** Face underlining can now use a wave.

** `read-regexp' has a new argument HISTORY; the first argument PROMPT
of `read-regexp' accepts a string ending with a colon and space, and its
second argument DEFAULTS can be a list of strings accessible via `M-n'
in the minibuffer ahead of other hard-coded useful regexp-related values.
More commands use `read-regexp' now to read their regexp arguments.

** Completion

*** New function `completion-table-with-quoting' to handle completion
in the presence of quoting, such as file completion in shell buffers.

*** New function `completion-table-subvert' to use an existing completion
table, but with a different prefix.

** Debugger

*** New error type and new function `user-error'.
These do not trigger the debugger.

*** New option `debugger-bury-or-kill', saying what to do with the
debugger buffer when exiting debug.

*** Set `debug-on-message' to enter the debugger when a certain
message is displayed in the echo area.  This can be useful when trying
to work out which code is doing something.

*** New var `inhibit-debugger', automatically set to prevent accidental
recursive invocations.

** Window handling

*** New command `fit-frame-to-buffer' adjusts the frame height to
fit the contents.

*** The command `fit-window-to-buffer' can adjust the frame height
if the new option `fit-frame-to-buffer' is non-nil.

*** New macro `with-temp-buffer-window', similar to
`with-output-to-temp-buffer'.

*** `temp-buffer-resize-mode' no longer resizes windows that have been
reused.

*** New option `switch-to-buffer-preserve-window-point' to restore a
window's point when switching buffers.

*** New display action alist entries `window-height' and `window-width'
specify the size of new windows created by `display-buffer'.

*** New display action alist entry `pop-up-frame-parameters', if
non-nil, specifies frame parameters to give any newly-created frame.

*** New display action alist entry `inhibit-switch-frame', if non-nil,
tells display action functions to avoid changing which frame is
selected.

*** New display action alist entry `previous-window', if non-nil,
specifies window to reuse in `display-buffer-in-previous-window'.

*** New display action functions `display-buffer-below-selected',
and `display-buffer-in-previous-window'.

*** The functions `get-lru-window', `get-mru-window' and `get-largest-window'
now accept a third argument to avoid choosing the selected window.

*** Additional values recognized for option `window-combination-limit'.

*** The following variables are obsolete, as they can be replaced by
appropriate entries in the `display-buffer-alist' function introduced
in Emacs 24.1:
**** `dired-shrink-to-fit'
**** `display-buffer-reuse-frames'
**** `display-buffer-function'
**** `special-display-buffer-names'
**** `special-display-frame-alist'
**** `special-display-function'
**** `special-display-regexps'

** Time

*** `current-time-string' no longer requires that its argument's year
must be in the range 1000..9999.  It now works with any year supported
by the underlying C implementation.

*** `current-time' now returns extended-format time stamps
(HIGH LOW USEC PSEC), where the new PSEC slot specifies picoseconds.
PSEC is typically a multiple of 1000 on current machines.  Other
functions that use this format, such as `file-attributes' and
`format-time-string', have been changed accordingly.  Old-format time
stamps are still accepted.

*** The format of timers in `timer-list' and `timer-idle-list' is now
[TRIGGERED-P HI-SECS LO-SECS USECS REPEAT-DELAY FUNCTION ARGS IDLE-DELAY PSECS].
The PSECS slot is new, and uses picosecond resolution.  It can be
accessed via the new `timer--psecs' accessor.

*** Last-modified time stamps in undo lists now are of the form
(t HI-SECS LO-SECS USECS PSECS) instead of (t HI-SECS . LO-SECS).

** EIEIO

*** Improved security when handling persistent objects:

**** `eieio-persistent-read' now features optional arguments for specifying
the class to load, as well as a flag stating whether subclasses are allowed;
if provided, other classes will be rejected by the reader.  For
compatibility with existing code, if the class is omitted only a
warning is issued.

**** New specialized reader for pulling in classes and signaling errors
without evaluation of suspicious code.

**** All slots that contain objects must have a :type.  Slots with lists
of objects must use a new type predicate for a list of an object type.

*** Support for `find-function' and similar utilities, through the addition
of filename support to generated symbols.

** Floating point functions now always return special values like NaN,
instead of signaling errors, if given invalid args; e.g., (log -1.0).
Previously, they returned NaNs on some platforms but signaled errors
on others.  The affected functions are acos, asin, tan, exp, expt,
log, log10, sqrt, and mod.

** New fringe bitmap `exclamation-mark'.

** Miscellaneous changes to special forms and macros

*** `defun' and `defmacro' are now macros rather than special forms.

*** `kbd' is now a function rather than a macro.

** Miscellaneous new functions

*** `set-temporary-overlay-map' sets up a temporary keymap that
takes precedence over most other maps for a short while (normally one key).

*** `autoloadp' tests if its argument is an autoloaded object.

*** `autoload-do-load' performs the autoloading operation.

*** `buffer-narrowed-p' tests if the buffer is narrowed.

*** `file-name-base' returns a file name sans directory and extension.

*** `function-get' fetches a function property, following aliases.

*** `posnp' tests if an object is a `posn'.

*** `system-users' returns the user names on the system.

*** `system-groups' returns the group names on the system.

*** `tty-top-frame' returns the topmost frame of a text terminal.

** The following functions and variables are obsolete:
*** `automount-dir-prefix' (use `directory-abbrev-alist')
*** `buffer-has-markers-at'
*** `macro-declaration-function' (use `macro-declarations-alist')
*** `window-system-version' (provides no useful information)
*** `dired-pop-to-buffer' (use `dired-mark-pop-up')
*** `query-replace-interactive'
*** `font-list-limit' (has had no effect since Emacs < 23)


* Changes in Emacs 24.3 on Non-Free Operating Systems

** Cygwin builds can use the native MS Windows user interface.
Pass `--with-w32' to configure.  The default remains the X11 interface.

** Two new functions are available in Cygwin builds:
`cygwin-convert-file-name-from-windows' and
`cygwin-convert-file-name-to-windows'.  These functions allow Lisp
code to access the Cygwin file-name mapping machinery to convert
between Cygwin and Windows-native file and directory names.

** When invoked with the -nw switch to run on the Windows text-mode terminal,
Emacs now supports `mouse-highlight', help-echo (in the echo area), and
`mouse-autoselect-window'.

** On MS Windows Vista and later Emacs now supports symbolic links.

** On MS Windows, you can pass `--without-libxml2' to configure.bat to omit
support for libxml2, even if its presence is detected.

** On Mac OS X, the Nextstep port requires OS X 10.4 or later.

** On Mac OS X, configure no longer automatically adds the Fink "/sw"
directories to the search path.  You must add them yourself if you want them.


* Changes in Emacs 24.2

** This is mainly a bug-fix release.


* Installation Changes in Emacs 24.1

** Emacs can be compiled with Gtk+ 3.0 if you pass --with-x-toolkit=gtk3
to configure.  Note that other libraries used by Emacs, RSVG and GConf,
also depend on Gtk+.  You can disable them with --without-rsvg and
--without-gconf.

** Emacs can be compiled with GnuTLS support.
This happens by default if a suitably recent version of the library is
found at build time.  To prevent this, use the configure option
`--without-gnutls'.  See below for GnuTLS features.

** Emacs can be compiled with SELinux support.
This happens by default if a suitably recent version of the library is
found at build time.  To prevent this, use the configure option
`--without-selinux'.  See below for SELinux features.

** Emacs can be compiled with ImageMagick support.
This happens by default if a suitably recent version of the library is
found at build time.  To prevent this, use the configure option
`--without-imagemagick'.  See below for ImageMagick features.
This feature is not available for the Nextstep or MS ports.

** Emacs can be compiled with libxml2 support.
This happens by default if a suitably recent version of the library is
found at build time.  To prevent this, use the configure option
`--without-xml2'.  See below for libxml2 features.

** By default, the installed Info and man pages are compressed.
You can disable this by configuring --without-compress-info.

** New configure option --with-wide-int.
With it, Emacs integers typically have 62 bits, even on 32-bit machines.
On 32-bit hosts, this raises the limit on buffer sizes from about 512 MiB
to about 2 GiB.

** New configure options: --with-mmdf, --with-mail-unlink, --with-mailhost.
These provide no new functionality, they just remove the need to edit
lib-src/Makefile by hand in order to use the associated features.

** New configure option --enable-use-lisp-union-type.
This is only useful for Emacs developers to debug certain types of bugs.
This is not a new feature; only the configure flag is new.

** The standalone programs digest-doc and sorted-doc are removed.
Emacs now uses Lisp commands `doc-file-to-man' and `doc-file-to-info'.

** The standalone program `fakemail' is removed.
If you need it, feedmail.el provides a superset of the functionality.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 24.1

** The --unibyte, --multibyte, --no-multibyte, and --no-unibyte
command line arguments, and the EMACS_UNIBYTE environment variable, no
longer have any effect.  (They were declared obsolete in Emacs 23.)

** New command line option `--no-site-lisp' removes site-lisp directories
from load-path.  -Q now implies this.  This option does not affect the
EMACSLOADPATH environment variable (and hence has no effect for
Nextstep builds).


* Changes in Emacs 24.1

** Completion

*** Many packages now use the `completion-at-point' command,
rather than implementing separate completion commands.

*** `completion-at-point' now handles tags and semantic completion.

*** Completion in a non-minibuffer now tries to detect the end of completion
and pops down the *Completions* buffer accordingly.

*** New option `completion-cycle-threshold' allows completion cycling.

*** New option `completion-category-overrides' for overriding the
default completion style in certain circumstances.

*** New completion style `substring'.

*** Completion of buffer names uses `substring' completion by default.

*** The option `widget-complete-field' has been removed.

** Mail changes

*** The first time you try sending mail, Emacs asks for a mail method.
This is implemented by a new default for `send-mail-function', which
is `sendmail-query-once'.  This offers to use the smtpmail package, or
to use the old defaults relying on external mail facilities
(`sendmail-send-it' on GNU/Linux and other Unix-like systems, and
`mailclient-send-it' on Windows).

*** Typing `C-c m' in the buffer made by `M-x report-emacs-bug'
transfers the report to your desktop's preferred mail client, if there
is one.  This uses either the "xdg-email" utility, or Mac OS's "open"
command.

*** See Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages for SMTPmail changes
and Mail mode changes

** Emacs server and client changes

*** New option `server-port' specifies the port for TCP Emacs servers.

*** New emacsclient argument -q/--quiet suppresses some status messages.

*** New emacsclient argument --frame-parameters specifies the frame
parameters of any newly-created graphical frame.

*** If emacsclient shuts down due to Emacs signaling an error,
its exit status is 1.

*** New emacsclient argument --parent-id ID.
This opens a client frame in parent X window ID, via XEmbed, similar
to the --parent-id argument to Emacs.

** Internationalization changes

*** Emacs now supports display and editing of bidirectional text.
Right-to-left (RTL) scripts, such as Arabic, Farsi, and Hebrew, are
displayed in the correct visual order as expected by users of those
scripts.  The display reordering is a "full bidirectionality" class
implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UBA).  Buffers
with no RTL text should look exactly the same as before.

**** New buffer-local variable `bidi-display-reordering'.
To disable display reordering in a buffer, change this to nil.

**** New buffer-local variable `bidi-paragraph-direction'.
If nil (the default), Emacs determines the base direction of each
paragraph from its text, as specified by the UBA.  Setting the value
to `right-to-left' or `left-to-right' forces a base direction on each
paragraph.

Paragraphs with right-to-left base direction are displayed starting at
the right window edge.

*** Enhanced support for characters with no glyphs in available fonts,
or, on text terminals, characters that cannot be encoded by the
terminal coding system.  The new option `glyphless-char-display-control'
specifies how to display them: as a hexadecimal code in a box, a thin
1-pixel space, an empty box, etc.

*** New input methods for Farsi and Bulgarian
(farsi-isiri-9147, farsi-transliterate-banan, bulgarian-alt-phonetic).

*** `nobreak-char-display' now also highlights Unicode hyphen chars
(U+2010 and U+2011).

*** New Hebrew translation of the Emacs Tutorial.
Type `C-u C-h t' to choose it in case your language setup doesn't
automatically select it.

** An Emacs Lisp package manager is now included.
This is a convenient way to download and install additional packages,
from a package repository at http://elpa.gnu.org.

*** M-x list-packages shows a list of packages, which can be
selected for installation.

*** New command `describe-package', bound to `C-h P'.

*** By default, all installed packages are loaded automatically when
Emacs starts up.  To disable this, set `package-enable-at-startup' to
nil.  To specify the packages to load, customize `package-load-list'.

** Custom theme changes

*** New command `M-x customize-themes', which provides a convenient
interface for enabling and disabling Custom themes.

*** New option `custom-theme-load-path' is the load path for themes.
Emacs no longer looks for Custom themes in `load-path'.  The default
value of `custom-theme-load-path' says to look for themes in
`custom-theme-directory', followed by a subdirectory of
`data-directory' named "themes/", which contains a small selection of
built-in Custom themes.

*** New option `custom-safe-themes' records known-safe theme files.
If a theme is not in this list, Emacs queries before loading it, and
offers to save the theme to `custom-safe-themes' automatically.  By
default, all themes included in Emacs are treated as safe.

** Improved GTK integration

*** GTK scroll-bars are now placed on the right by default.
The function `set-scroll-bar-mode' can change this.

*** GTK tool bars can have just text, just images or images and text.
Customize `tool-bar-style' to choose the style.  On a Gnome desktop,
the default is taken from desktop settings.

*** GTK tool bars can be placed on any edge of the frame.
The frame-parameter tool-bar-position controls this.  It takes the
values top, left, right or bottom.  The Options => Show/Hide menu has
entries for this.

*** The default colors for selected text (the `region' face) are taken
from the GTK theme when Emacs is built with GTK.

*** Emacs uses GTK tooltips by default if built with GTK.
You can disable this by changing `x-gtk-use-system-tooltips' to nil.

** Graphical interface changes

*** On graphical displays, the mode-line no longer ends in dashes.
Also, the first dash (which does not indicate anything) is just
displayed as a space.

*** `menu-bar-select-buffer-function' lets you choose another operation
instead of `switch-to-buffer' when selecting an item in the Buffers menu.

*** Lucid menus and dialogs can display antialiased fonts if Emacs is
built with Xft.  These fonts can be set via X resources, for example:
Emacs.pane.menubar.font: Courier-12

** Exiting changes

*** Emacs now calls `kill-emacs' if it receives SIGTERM or SIGHUP,
or if it receives a SIGINT signal in batch mode.

*** `kill-emacs-hook' is now also run in batch mode.
Third-party code which adds to `kill-emacs-hook' should check if they
do the right thing in batch mode.

** Scrolling changes

*** New scrolling commands `scroll-up-command' and `scroll-down-command'
(bound to C-v/[next] and M-v/[prior]) do not signal errors at top/bottom
of buffer at first key-press (instead they move to top/bottom of buffer)
when `scroll-error-top-bottom' is non-nil.

*** New option `scroll-error-top-bottom' (see above).

*** New scrolling commands `scroll-up-line' and `scroll-down-line'
scroll a line instead of full screen.

*** New property `scroll-command' should be set on a command's symbol to
define it as a scroll command affected by `scroll-preserve-screen-position'.

*** If you customize `scroll-conservatively' to a value greater than 100,
Emacs will never recenter point in the window when it scrolls due to
cursor motion commands or commands that move point (e.f., `M-g M-g').
Previously, you needed to use `most-positive-fixnum' as the value of
`scroll-conservatively' to achieve the same effect.

*** "Aggressive" scrolling now honors the scroll margins.
If you customize `scroll-up-aggressively' or
`scroll-down-aggressively' and move point off the window, Emacs now
scrolls the window so as to avoid positioning point inside the scroll
margin.

** Basic SELinux support has been added.
This requires Emacs to be linked with libselinux at build time.

*** Emacs preserves the SELinux file context when backing up.
Also, the function `copy-file' has an extra optional argument for
preserving SELinux context, and the return value of `backup-buffer'
now includes the SELinux context.

*** New functions `file-selinux-context' and `set-file-selinux-context'
get and set the SELinux context of a file.

** Trash changes

*** `delete-by-moving-to-trash' now only affects commands that specify
trashing.  This avoids inadvertently trashing temporary files.

*** Calling `delete-file' or `delete-directory' with a prefix argument
now forces true deletion, regardless of `delete-by-moving-to-trash'.

** File- and directory-local variable changes

*** You can stop directory local vars from applying to subdirectories.
Add an element (subdirs . nil) to the alist portion of any variables
settings to indicate that the section should not apply to
subdirectories.

*** Directory local variables can apply to some file-less buffers.
Affected modes include dired, vc-dir, and log-edit.  For example,
adding "(diff-mode . ((mode . whitespace)))" to .dir-locals.el will
turn on `whitespace-mode' for *vc-diff* buffers.  Modes should call
`hack-dir-local-variables-non-file-buffer' to support this.

*** Using "mode: MINOR-MODE" to enable a minor mode is deprecated.
Instead, use "eval: (minor-mode 1)".

*** The variable `inhibit-first-line-modes-regexps' has been renamed
to `inhibit-local-variables-regexps'.  As the name suggests, it now
applies to ALL file local variables, not just -*- lines.  The
associated `inhibit-first-line-modes-suffixes' has been renamed in the
corresponding way.

** Window changes

*** The `quit-window' command now restores the last buffer displayed
in the quitted window.

*** Resizing an Emacs frame now preserves proportional window sizes,
modulo restrictions like window minimum sizes and fixed-size windows.

*** The behavior of `display-buffer' is now customizable in detail.

**** New option `display-buffer-base-action' specifies a list of
user-determined display "actions" (functions and optional arguments
for choosing the displaying window).

This takes precedence over the default display action, which is
specified by `display-buffer-fallback-action'.

**** New option `display-buffer-alist' maps buffer name regexps to
display actions, taking precedence over `display-buffer-base-action'.

*** New option `window-combination-limit'.
The new option `window-combination-limit' allows to return the space
obtained for resizing or creating a window more reliably to the window
from which such space was obtained.

*** New option `window-combination-resize'.
The new option `window-combination-resize' allows to split a window that
otherwise cannot be split because it's too small by stealing space from
other windows in the same combination.  Subsequent resizing or deletion
of the window will resize all windows in the same combination as well.

*** New option `frame-auto-hide-function' lets you choose between
iconifying or deleting a frame when burying a buffer in a dedicated
frame, or quitting a window showing a buffer in a frame of its own.

*** New commands `maximize-window' and `minimize-window'.
These maximize and minimize the size of a window within its frame.

*** New commands `switch-to-prev-buffer' and `switch-to-next-buffer'.
These functions allow to navigate through the live buffers that have
been shown in a specific window.

** Minibuffer changes

*** The inactive minibuffer has its own major mode `minibuffer-inactive-mode'.
This is handy for minibuffer-only frames, and is also used for the feature
where mouse-1 pops up *Messages*"', which can now easily be changed.

*** Minibuffers set `truncate-lines' to nil.
If you want to change the value to something else, you could use
for example `minibuffer-setup-hook'.

** `auto-mode-case-fold' is now enabled by default.

** `backup-by-copying-when-mismatch' now defaults to t.

** New basic faces `error', `warning', `success'.
These are used to highlight text indicating failure, caution or
successful operation.

** New option `list-colors-sort' defines the color sort order
for `list-colors-display'.

** The variable `focus-follows-mouse' now always defaults to nil.


* Editing Changes in Emacs 24.1

** Search changes

*** C-y in Isearch is now bound to `isearch-yank-kill', instead of
`isearch-yank-line'.

*** M-y in Isearch is now bound to `isearch-yank-pop', instead of
`isearch-yank-kill'.

*** M-s C-e in Isearch is now bound to `isearch-yank-line'.

** New commands `count-words-region' and `count-words'.

*** M-= is bound to `count-words-region', not `count-lines-region'.
The `count-words-region' command, when called interactively, reports
the number of lines, words, and characters in the region.  It is a
superset of the old `count-lines-region', which is now an obsolete
alias for it.

** The command `just-one-space' (M-SPC), if given a negative argument,
also deletes newlines around point.

** Deletion changes

*** New option `delete-active-region'.
If non-nil, [delete] and DEL delete the region if it is active and no
prefix argument is given.  If set to `kill', those commands kill
instead.

*** New command `delete-forward-char', bound to [delete].
This is meant for interactive use, and obeys `delete-active-region'.
The command `delete-char' does not obey `delete-active-region'.

*** `delete-backward-char' is now a Lisp function.
Apart from obeying `delete-active-region', its behavior is unchanged.
However, the byte compiler now warns if it is called from Lisp; Lisp
callers should use delete-char with a negative argument instead.

*** The option `mouse-region-delete-keys' has been deleted.

** Selection changes.

The default handling of clipboard and primary selections has been
changed to conform with modern X applications.  In short, most
commands for killing and yanking text now use the clipboard, while
mouse commands use the primary selection.

In the following, we provide a list of these changes, followed by a
list of steps to get the old behavior back if you prefer that.

*** `select-active-regions' now defaults to t.
Merely selecting text (e.g. with drag-mouse-1) no longer puts it in
the kill ring.  The selected text is put in the primary selection, if
the system possesses a separate primary selection facility (e.g. X).

**** `select-active-regions' also accepts a new value, `only'.
This means to only set the primary selection for temporarily active
regions (usually made by mouse-dragging or shift-selection);
"ordinary" active regions, such as those made with C-SPC followed by
point motion, do not alter the primary selection.

**** `mouse-drag-copy-region' now defaults to nil.

*** mouse-2 is now bound to `mouse-yank-primary'.
This pastes from the primary selection, ignoring the kill-ring.
Previously, mouse-2 was bound to `mouse-yank-at-click'.

*** `x-select-enable-clipboard' now defaults to t on all platforms.

*** `x-select-enable-primary' now defaults to nil.
Thus, commands that kill text or copy it to the kill-ring (such as
M-w, C-w, and C-k) also use the clipboard---not the primary selection.

**** The "Copy", "Cut", and "Paste" items in the "Edit" menu are now
exactly equivalent to M-w, C-w, and C-y respectively.

**** Note that on MS-Windows, `x-select-enable-clipboard' was already
non-nil by default, as Windows does not support the primary selection
between applications.

*** To return to the previous behavior, do the following:

**** Change `select-active-regions' to nil.
**** Change `mouse-drag-copy-region' to t.
**** Change `x-select-enable-primary' to t (on X only).
**** Change `x-select-enable-clipboard' to nil.
**** Bind `mouse-yank-at-click' to mouse-2.

*** Support for X cut buffers has been removed.

*** X clipboard managers are now supported.
To inhibit this, change `x-select-enable-clipboard-manager' to nil.

** New command `C-x r N' (`rectangle-number-lines') numbers the lines
in the current rectangle.  With a prefix argument, this prompts for a
number to count from and for a format string.

** `redisplay-dont-pause' now defaults to t.
This makes Emacs feel more responsive to editing commands that arrive
at high rate, e.g. if you lean on some key, because stopping redisplay
in the middle (when this variable is nil) forces more expensive
updates later on, and Emacs appears to be unable to keep up.

** The behavior of <TAB> for active regions in Text mode has changed.
In Text and related modes, typing <TAB> (`indent-for-tab-command')
when the region is active causes Emacs to indent all the lines in the
region, aligning them with the line previous to the first line in the
region (or with the left margin if there is no previous line).

** When `occur' is called with a prefix argument, matching strings are
collected into the `*Occur*' buffer without line numbers.  If there
are parenthesized subexpressions in the specified regexp, `occur'
reads replacement text that may contain \\& and \\N whose convention
follows `replace-match'.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 24.1

** Archive Mode has basic support for browsing and updating 7z archives.

** BibTeX mode

*** BibTeX mode now supports biblatex.
Use the variable `bibtex-dialect' to select different BibTeX dialects.
`bibtex-entry-field-alist' is now an obsolete alias for
`bibtex-BibTeX-entry-alist'.

*** New command `bibtex-search-entries', bound to C-c C-a.

*** New `bibtex-entry-format' option `sort-fields', disabled by default.

*** New variable `bibtex-search-entry-globally'.

** Browse-url

*** New option `browse-url-mailto-function' specifies how to handle "mailto:"s.

*** The default browser used by the package is now the "xdg-open" program,
on platforms that support it.  This calls your desktop's preferred browser.

** Calc

*** Support for musical notes.

*** Support for logarithmic units.

*** No longer uses the tex prefix for TeX specific unit names when
using TeX or LaTeX mode.

*** New option to highlight selections using faces.

*** `calc-histogram' has the option of using a vector to determine the bins.

*** New "O" option prefix.

*** Use the "O" prefix to "d r" (`calc-radix') to turn on twos-complement mode.

** Calendar, Diary, and Appt

*** Diary entries can contain non-printing "comments".
See the variable `diary-comment-start'.

*** Appointments can specify their individual warning times.
See the variable `appt-warning-time-regexp'.

*** The function specified by `appt-disp-window-function' may be passed
lists of arguments if multiple appointments are due at similar times.
If you are using a custom function for this, you should update it.

*** New function `diary-hebrew-birthday'.

*** Elements of `calendar-day-abbrev-array' and `calendar-month-abbrev-array'
may no longer be nil, but must all be strings.

*** The obsolete (since Emacs 22.1) method of enabling the appt
package by adding `appt-make-list' to `diary-hook' has been removed.
Use `appt-activate' instead.

*** Some appt variables (obsolete since Emacs 22.1) have been removed:
appt-issue-message (use the function appt-activate)
appt-visible/appt-msg-window (use the variable appt-display-format)

*** Some diary function aliases (obsolete since Emacs 22.1) have been removed:
view-diary-entries, list-diary-entries, show-all-diary-entries

** CC Mode

*** New feature to "guess" the style in an existing buffer.
The main entry point is M-x c-guess.

*** Java Mode now supports Java 5.0 (Tiger) and 6 (Mustang).

*** `c-beginning-of-defun' and `c-end-of-defun' now respect nested scopes.
Thus C-M-a will, by default, go to the beginning of the immediate function,
not the top level.

*** "Macros with semicolons" can be registered for correct indentation.
Where such a macro ends a line (no semicolon) the next statement is no longer
parsed as a statement continuation.

** Comint and modes derived from it use the standard completion code.

** Compilation mode

*** Compilation mode can be used without Font Lock mode.
`compilation-parse-errors-function' is now obsolete.

*** New variable `compilation-filter-start', which is bound while
`compilation-filter-hook' runs.  It records the start position of the
text inserted by `compilation-filter'.

*** `compilation-error-screen-columns' and `compilation-first-column'
are obeyed in the editing buffer.  So programming language modes can
set them, whereas previously only the value in the *Compilation*
buffer was used.

** Customize

*** Customize buffers now contain a search field.
The search is performed using `customize-apropos'.
To turn off the search field, set `custom-search-field' to nil.

*** Options in customize group buffers start out hidden if not customized.
Use the arrow to the left of the option name to toggle visibility.

*** custom-buffer-sort-alphabetically now defaults to t.

*** The color widget now has a "Choose" button, which allows you to
choose a color via `list-colors-display'.

** D-Bus

*** It is now possible to access buses other than the default system
or session bus.

*** The `dbus-register-method' and `dbus-register-property' functions
optionally do not register names.

*** The new function `dbus-register-service' registers a known service
name on a D-Bus without also registering a property or a method.

** Dired-x

*** C-x C-j (`dired-jump') and C-x 4 C-j (`dired-jump-other-window'),
if called with a prefix argument, read a file name from the minibuffer
instead of using the current buffer.

*** The "dired local variables" feature of Dired-x is obsolete.
The standard directory local variables feature replaces it.

** ERC changes

*** New options `erc-autojoin-timing' and `erc-autojoin-delay',
controlling attempts to autojoin a channel.

*** New variable `erc-coding-system-precedence': If we use `undecided'
as the server coding system, this variable will then be consulted.
The default is to decode strings that can be decoded as utf-8 as
utf-8, and do the normal `undecided' decoding for the rest.

** Eshell changes

*** The default value of `eshell-directory-name' has changed
to be an "eshell" directory in `user-emacs-directory'.
The old "~/.eshell/" directory is still used if it exists, though.

** gdb-mi

*** The M-x gdb command now uses the GDB Machine Interface protocol.
It now supports multithread non-stop debugging and simultaneous
debugging of several threads.

** Image mode

*** RET (`image-toggle-animation') toggles animation, if applicable.
Animation plays once, unless the option `image-animate-loop' is non-nil.

** Info

*** New command M-x info-display-manual displays a named Info manual.
If that manual is already visited in some Info buffer, it displays
that buffer.  (This is handy if you have many manuals in many *info*
buffers, and don't remember the name of the buffer visiting the manual
you want to consult.)  Otherwise, it loads and displays the manual.

*** `e' is now bound to `end-of-buffer' rather than to `Info-edit'.
This is for compatibility with the stand-alone Info reader program,
and also because `Info-edit' is a rarely used command that is disabled
by default.

** Mail mode changes (not Message mode)

*** New command M-x mail-add-attachment for adding MIME attachments

*** The command M-x mail-attach-file was renamed to M-x mail-insert-file.
(Its name is misleading, since it has nothing to do with MIME
attachments.)  The old name is now an obsolete alias to the new name.

** MH-E has been updated to MH-E version 8.3.1.
See MH-E-NEWS for details.

** Modula-2 mode provides auto-indentation.

** mpc.el: Can use pseudo tags of the form tag1|tag2 as a union of two tags.

** nXML mode no longer binds C-RET to `nxml-complete'.
Completion is now performed via `completion-at-point', bound to C-M-i
or M-TAB.  If `nxml-bind-meta-tab-to-complete-flag' is non-nil (the
default), this performs tag completion.

** Org mode has been updated to version 7.8.09.
See ORG-NEWS for details.

** Prolog mode has been completely revamped, with lots of additional
functionality such as more intelligent indentation, electricity,
support for more variants, including Mercury, and a lot more.

** Rmail

*** The command `rmail-epa-decrypt' decrypts OpenPGP data
in the Rmail incoming message.

*** The variable `rmail-message-filter' no longer has any effect.
This change was made in Emacs 23.1 but was not advertised at the time.
Try using `rmail-show-message-hook' instead.

** Shell mode

*** M-x shell prompts for the shell path name if the default directory
is a remote file name and neither the environment variable $ESHELL nor
the variable `explicit-shell-file-name' is set.

*** TAB is now bound to the standard `completion-at-point' command,
which now implements the pcomplete rules for shell command completion.

** SMTPmail

*** SMTPmail now uses encrypted connections (via STARTTLS) by default
if the mail server supports them.  This uses either built-in GnuTLS
support, or the starttls.el library.  Customize `smtpmail-stream-type'
to change this.

*** The variable `smtpmail-auth-credentials' has been removed.
By default, the information is now stored in the file ~/.authinfo.
This was the default value of smtpmail-auth-credentials.  If you had
customized smtpmail-auth-credentials to a list of user names and
passwords, those settings are not used.  During your first connection
to the smtp server, Emacs will prompt for the user name and password,
and offer to save them to ~/.authinfo.  Or you can manually copy the
credentials to ~/.authinfo.  For example, if you had

  (setq smtpmail-auth-credentials
        '(("mail.example.org" 25 "jim" "s!cret")))

then the equivalent line in ~/.authinfo would be

  machine mail.example.org port 25 login jim password s!cret

See the auth-source manual for more information, e.g. on encrypting
the credentials file.

*** The variable `smtpmail-starttls-credentials' has been removed.
If you had that set, you need to put

  machine smtp.whatever.foo port 25 key "~/.my_smtp_tls.key" cert "~/.my_smtp_tls.cert"

in your ~/.authinfo file instead.

*** SMTPmail defaults to using the address in the From: header as the
SMTP MAIL FROM envelope.  To override this, set `mail-envelope-from'
to the address you wish to use instead.

** SQL mode

*** New options `sql-port', `sql-connection-alist', `sql-send-terminator',
and `sql-oracle-scan-on'.

*** New options controlling prompting for login parameters.
Each supported product has a custom variable `sql-*-login-params',
which is a list of the parameters to be prompted for before a
connection is established.

*** The command `sql-product-interactive' now takes a prefix argument,
which causes it to prompt for an SQL product.

*** Product-specific SQL interactive commands now take prefix arguments.
These commands (`sql-sqlite', `sql-postgres', `sql-mysql', etc.),
given a prefix argument, prompt for a name for the SQL interactive
buffer.  This reduces the need for calling `sql-rename-buffer'.

*** SQL interactive modes suppress command continuation prompts, and
replace tabs with spaces.  The first change impacts multiple line SQL
statements entered with C-j between each line, statements yanked into
the buffer and statements sent with `sql-send-*' functions.  The
second prevents the MySQL and Postgres interpreters from listing
object name completions when sent text via `sql-send-*' functions.

*** New command `sql-connect' starts a predefined SQLi session,
using the login parameters from `sql-connection-alist'.

*** New "Save Connection" menu item in SQLi buffers.
This gathers the login params specified for the SQLi session, if it
was not started by a connection, and saves them as a new connection.

*** New commands for listing database objects and details:
sql-list-all and sql-list-table.

*** An API for manipulating SQL product definitions has been added.

** TeX modes

*** latex-electric-env-pair-mode keeps \begin..\end matched on the fly.

** Tramp

*** New inline access method "ksu" (kerberized su).

*** The following access methods are discontinued: "ssh1_old",
"ssh2_old", "scp1_old", "scp2_old", "imap", "imaps" and "fish".

*** The user option `remote-file-name-inhibit-cache' controls whether
remote file attributes are cached for better performance.

*** The option `ange-ftp-binary-file-name-regexp' has changed its
default value to "".

*** Handlers for `file-selinux-context' and `set-file-selinux-context'
for remote machines which support SELinux.

** New function `url-queue-retrieve', which behaves like url-retrieve,
but with limits (`url-queue-parallel-processes', `url-queue-timeout') on
the degree of parallelism.

** VC and related modes

*** Support for pulling on distributed version control systems.
The command C-x v + (`vc-pull') runs a "pull" operation, if it is
supported (currently with Bzr, Git, and Mercurial), to update the
current branch and working tree.  A prefix argument means to prompt
the user for specifics, e.g. a pull location.

*** `vc-update' is now an alias for `vc-pull'.

*** Support for merging on distributed version control systems.
The command C-x v m (`vc-merge') now runs a "merge" operation, if it
is supported (currently with Bzr, Git, and Mercurial), to merge
changes from another branch into the current one.  It prompts for
specifics, e.g. a merge source.

*** New option `vc-revert-show-diff' controls whether `vc-revert'
shows a diff while querying the user.  It defaults to t.

*** Log entries in some Log View buffers can be toggled to display a
longer description by typing RET (log-view-toggle-entry-display).
This is currently supported for Bzr, Git, and Mercurial (to support
another backend, define a `log-view-expanded-log-entry-function').
In the Log View buffers made by C-x v L (`vc-print-root-log'), you can
use this to display the full log entry for the revision at point.

*** New command `vc-ediff' allows visual comparison of two revisions
of a file similar to `vc-diff', but using ediff backend.

*** The option `vc-initial-comment' was removed in Emacs 23.2, but
this was not advertised at the time.

*** `vc-toggle-read-only' is an obsolete alias for `toggle-read-only'.
Since Emacs 23, it has done the same thing as `toggle-read-only', but
this was not advertised at the time.

** Obsolete modes

*** abbrevlist.el

*** erc-hecomplete.el (use erc-pcomplete.el instead)

*** partial-completion-mode (complete.el) is obsolete.
You can get a comparable behavior with:
(setq completion-styles '(partial-completion initials))
(setq completion-pcm-complete-word-inserts-delimiters t)

*** pc-mode.el is obsolete (CUA mode is much more comprehensive).

*** pgg is obsolete (use EasyPG instead).

*** sregex.el is obsolete, since rx.el is a strict superset.

*** s-region.el and pc-select.el are obsolete.
They are superseded by shift-select-mode, enabled by default since 23.1.

*** vc-mcvs.el is obsolete (for lack of a maintainer).

** Miscellaneous

*** The Landmark game is now invoked with `landmark', not `lm'.
Its functions and variables have been similarly renamed.

*** In `ido-file-completion-map', C-v is no longer bound to `ido-toggle-vc'.
(This interfered with cua-mode.)

*** f90.el has some support for Fortran 2008 syntax.

*** `copyright-fix-years' can optionally convert consecutive years to ranges.

*** New command `nato-region' converts text to NATO phonetic alphabet.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 24.1

** Occur Edit mode applies edits made in *Occur* buffers to the
original buffers.  It is bound to "e" in Occur mode.

** New global minor mode electric-pair-mode.
When enabled, typing an open parenthesis automatically inserts the
matching closing one.

** New global minor mode electric-indent-mode.
When enabled, typing certain characters triggers reindentation.
Major modes wishing to use this can set electric-indent-chars or
electric-indent-functions.

** New global minor mode electric-layout-mode.
When enabled, typing certain characters automatically inserts newlines.
Major modes wishing to use this can set electric-layout-rules.

** tabulated-list.el provides a generic major mode for tabulated data,
from which other modes can be derived.

** pcase.el provides the ML-style pattern matching macro `pcase'.

** secrets.el is an implementation of the Secret Service API, an
interface to password managers like GNOME Keyring or KDE Wallet.  The
Secret Service API requires D-Bus for communication.  The command
`secrets-show-secrets' offers a buffer with a visualization of the
secrets.

** notifications.el provides an implementation of the Desktop
Notifications API.  It requires D-Bus for communication.

** soap-client.el supports access to SOAP web services from Emacs.
soap-inspect.el is an interactive inspector for SOAP WSDL structures.

** New generic mode, xmodmap-generic-mode, for xmodmap files.

** New emacs-lock.el package.
The previous version has been moved to obsolete/old-emacs-lock.el.
Now, there is a proper minor mode `emacs-lock-mode'.  Protection
against exiting Emacs and killing the buffer can be set separately.
The mechanism for automatically turning off protection for buffers
with dead inferior processes has been generalized.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 24.1

** Passing a nil argument to a minor mode function call now ENABLES
the minor mode unconditionally.  This is so that you can write e.g.

 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'foo-mode)

to enable foo-mode in Text mode buffers, removing the need for
`turn-on-foo-mode' style functions.  This affects all mode commands
defined by `define-minor-mode'.  If called interactively, the mode
command still toggles the minor mode.

** The return value of `backup-buffer' has changed.
It is now a list of three elements, where the second element is a list
describing the original file's SELinux context.  If Emacs or the
system lacks SELinux support, the context list is (nil nil nil nil).
See "Basic SELinux support" above, under "Changes in Emacs 24.1".

** `char-direction-table' and the `char-direction' function were deleted.
They were buggy and inferior to the new support of bidirectional
editing introduced in Emacs 24.  If you need the bidirectional
properties of a character, use `get-char-code-property' with the last
argument `bidi-class'.

** `copy-directory' now copies the source directory as a subdirectory
of the target directory, if the latter is an existing directory.  The
new optional arg COPY-CONTENTS, if non-nil, makes the function copy
the contents directly into a pre-existing target directory.

** For mouse click input events in the text area, the Y pixel
coordinate in the POSITION list now counts from the top of the text
area, excluding any header line.  Previously, it counted from the top
of the header line.

** Support for "old-style" backquotes, obsolete for 10+ years, has
been further reduced.  Now a backquote not followed by a space is
always treated as a "new-style" backquote.  Please remove all
"old-style" backquotes from your code.  If your code uses backquotes
as documented in the Elisp manual, and compiles without warning, then
you have nothing to do in this regard.  Code not following the
appropriate conventions may fail to compile.

The most common cause of trouble seems to be an old-style backquote
followed by a newline.  Another cause of trouble is vector notation
for key sequence notation: instead of [(control ,)] and [(control ')],
you should write [(control ?,)] and [(control ?')], which will work in
older Emacsen too.

** The macro `eval-at-startup' was removed in Emacs 23.2, but this
was not advertised at the time.  The function `custom-initialize-delay'
replaced all known uses.

** `view-buffer' now treats special mode-class in the same way that
`view-file' has since Emacs 22 (i.e. it won't enable View mode if the
major mode is special).

** Menu and tool bar changes

*** During startup, Emacs no longer adds entries for `menu-bar-lines'
and `tool-bar-lines' to `default-frame-alist' and `initial-frame-alist'.
With these alist entries omitted, `make-frame' checks the value of the
variable `menu-bar-mode'/`tool-bar-mode' to determine whether to create
a menu-bar or tool-bar, respectively.  If the alist entries are added,
they override the value of `menu-bar-mode'/`tool-bar-mode'.

*** The menu bar bindings's caches are not used any more.
Use (where-is-internal <def> nil t) instead.

** Regions created by mouse dragging are now normal active regions,
similar to those created by shift-selection (see Selection changes
above).  In previous Emacs versions, these regions were delineated by
`mouse-drag-overlay'; that variable has been removed.

** The fourth argument of `filter-buffer-substring' has been removed.
If you want to remove text properties from the final result, simply
pass the result through substring-no-properties.

** cl.el no longer provides `cl-19'.

** The following obsolete functions and aliases have been removed
(the appropriate new function is given in parentheses; "not needed"
means you can just remove all calls to the function in question):

*** `comint-kill-output' (`comint-delete-output')
*** `decompose-composite-char' (`char-to-string')
*** `outline-visible' (`outline-invisible-p')
*** `internal-find-face' (`facep')
*** `internal-get-face' (`facep and check-face')
*** `frame-update-faces' (not needed)
*** `frame-update-face-colors' (`frame-set-background-mode')
*** `x-frob-font-weight' and `x-frob-font-slant' (`make-face-*' functions)
*** `x-make-font-bold and x-make-font-demibold (`make-face-bold')
*** `x-make-font-italic' and `x-make-font-oblique' (`make-face-italic')
*** `x-make-font-bold-italic' (`make-face-bold-italic')
*** `x-make-font-unbold' (`make-face-unbold')
*** `x-make-font-unitalic' (`make-face-unitalic')
*** `mldrag-drag-mode-line' (`mouse-drag-mode-line')
*** `mldrag-drag-vertical-line' (`mouse-drag-vertical-line')
*** `iswitchb-default-keybindings' (`iswitchb-mode')
*** `char-bytes' (== 1)
*** `isearch-return-char' (`isearch-printing-char')
*** `make-local-hook' (not needed)
*** `set-screen-height' (`set-frame-height')
*** `set-screen-width' (`set-frame-width')

** The following obsolete variables and varaliases have been removed
(the appropriate new variable is given in parentheses):

*** `checkdoc-minor-keymap' (`checkdoc-minor-mode-map')
*** `vc-header-alist' (`vc-BACKEND-header')
*** `directory-sep-char' (== ?/)
*** `font-lock-defaults-alist' (`font-lock-defaults')
*** `e' (`float-e').

** The following obsolete files were removed:
sc.el, x-menu.el, rnews.el, rnewspost.el

** The format of the finder-inf.el file has changed, since the Finder
mechanism is now based on the package system.  The variable
`finder-package-info' is replaced by `package--builtins' and
`finder-keywords-hash'.

** When generating autoloads, `update-directory-autoloads' no longer
assumes every inspected file is in your `load-path'.  It instead
generates relative names according to the current `load-path'.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 24.1

** Code can now use lexical scoping by default instead of dynamic scoping.
The `lexical-binding' variable enables lexical scoping for local
variables.  It is typically set via a file-local variable in the first
line of the file, in which case it applies to all the code in that
file.

*** `eval' takes a new optional argument `lexical' to choose the new lexical
binding instead of the old dynamic binding mode.

*** Lexically scoped interpreted functions are represented with a new form
of function value which looks like (closure ENV ARGS &rest BODY).

*** New macro `letrec' to define recursive local functions.

*** `defvar' and `defconst' now mark the variable as special (dynamic).
So do `defcustom' and other forms that call `defvar' as a subroutine.

*** New function `special-variable-p' to check whether a variable is
declared as dynamically bound.

*** The form ((lambda ...) ...) is deprecated.

** An Emacs Lisp testing tool is now included.
Emacs Lisp developers can use this tool to write automated tests for
their code.  See the ERT info manual for details.

** Changes for bidirectional display and editing

*** New function `current-bidi-paragraph-direction'.
This returns the base direction of the paragraph at point.

*** New function `bidi-string-mark-left-to-right'.
Given a string containing characters from right-to-left scripts, this
function returns another string which can be safely inserted into a
buffer, such that any following text will be always displayed to the
right of that string.  (This works by appending an invisible Unicode
"LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK" character if the argument string might need it.)

This is useful when the buffer has overall left-to-right paragraph
direction and you need to insert a string whose contents are not known
in advance, without disrupting the layout of the line.

** Window changes

*** Window tree functions are accessible in Elisp.
Functions are provided to return the parent, siblings or child windows
of any window including internal windows (windows not associated with a
buffer) in the window tree.

**** New function `window-valid-p' gives non-nil for live and internal
windows.

**** Window manipulation can deal with internal windows.
Many window handling functions like `split-window', `delete-window', or
`delete-other-windows' as well as the window resizing functions can now
act on any window including internal ones.

*** window-total-height/-width vs window-body-height/-width.
The function `window-height' has been renamed to `window-total-height'
and `window-width' has been renamed to `window-body-width'.  The old
names are provided as aliases.  Two new functions `window-total-width'
and `window-body-height' are provided.

*** Window parameters specific to window handling functions.
For each window you can specify a parameter to override the default
behavior of a number of functions like `split-window', `delete-window'
and `delete-other-windows'.  The variable `ignore-window-parameters'
allows to ignore processing such parameters.

*** New semantics of third argument of `split-window'.
The third argument of `split-window' has been renamed to SIDE and can be
set to any of the values 'below, 'right, 'above, or 'left to make the
new window appear on the corresponding side of the window that shall be
split.  Any other value of SIDE will cause `split-window' to split the
window into two side-by-side windows as before.

*** Window resizing functions.
A new standard function for resizing windows called `window-resize' has
been introduced.  This and all other functions for resizing windows no
longer delete any windows when they become too small.

*** Deleting the selected window now selects the most recently selected
live window on that frame instead.

*** `adjust-window-trailing-edge' adjustments.
`adjust-window-trailing-edge' can now deal with fixed-size windows and
is able to resize other windows if a window adjacent to the trailing
edge cannot be shrunk any more.  This makes its behavior more similar to
that of Emacs 21 without compromising, however, its inability to delete
windows which was introduced in Emacs 22.

*** Window-local buffer lists.
Windows now have local buffer lists.  This means that removing a buffer
from display in a window will preferably show the buffer previously
shown in that window with its previous window-start and window-point
positions.  This also means that the same buffer may be automatically
shown twice even if it already appears in another window.

*** `switch-to-buffer' has a new optional argument FORCE-SAME-WINDOW,
which if non-nil requires the buffer to be displayed in the currently
selected window, signaling an error otherwise.  If nil, another window
can be used, e.g. if the selected one is strongly dedicated.

*** `split-window-vertically' and `split-window-horizontally' renamed
to `split-window-below' and `split-window-right' respectively.
The old names are kept as aliases.

*** Display actions

**** The second arg to `display-buffer' and `pop-to-buffer' is now
named ACTION, and takes a display action of the same form as
`display-buffer-base-action' (see Changes, above).  A non-nil,
non-list value is treated specially, as the old meaning.

**** New variable `display-buffer-overriding-action'.

**** The procedure of `display-buffer' etc. to choose a window is
determined by combining `display-buffer-overriding-action',
`display-buffer-alist', the ACTION arg, `display-buffer-base-action',
and `display-buffer-fallback-action'.  The second and fourth of these
are user-customizable variables.

See the docstring of `display-buffer' for details.

*** New functions `window-state-get' and `window-state-put'.
These functions allow to save and restore the state of an arbitrary
frame or window as an Elisp object.

** Completion

*** New variable `completion-extra-properties' used to specify extra
properties of the current completion:
- :annotate-function, same as the old completion-annotate-function.
- :exit-function, function to call after completion took place.

*** Functions on `completion-at-point-functions' can return any of the
properties valid for `completion-extra-properties'.

*** `completion-annotate-function' is obsolete.

*** New `metadata' method for completion tables.  The metadata thus returned
can specify various details of the data returned by `all-completions':
- `category' is the kind of objects returned (e.g., `buffer', `file', ...),
  used to select a style in completion-category-overrides.
- `annotation-function' to add annotations in *Completions*.
- `display-sort-function' to specify how to sort entries in *Completions*.
- `cycle-sort-function' to specify how to sort entries when cycling.

*** `minibuffer-local-filename-must-match-map' is not used any more.
Instead, the bindings in `minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map'
are combined with `minibuffer-local-must-match-map'.

*** New variable `completing-read-function' allows overriding the
behavior of `completing-read'.

** `glyphless-char-display' can now distinguish between graphical and
text terminal display, via a char-table entry that is a cons cell.

** `pre-command-hook'/`post-command-hook' are not reset to nil on error.
Instead, the offending function is removed.

** New hook types

*** New function `run-hook-wrapped' for running an abnormal hook by
passing the hook functions as arguments to a "wrapping" function.
Like `run-hook-with-args-until-success', it stops at the first
non-nil return value.

*** New macro `with-wrapper-hook' for running an abnormal hook as a
set of "wrapping" filters, similar to around advice.
(A version of this macro was actually added in Emacs 23.2 but was not
advertised at the time.)

** Debugger changes

*** New macro `condition-case-unless-debug' (this was actually added in
Emacs 23.1 as condition-case-no-debug, but not advertised)

*** The macro `with-demoted-errors' was added in Emacs 23.1, but not advertised.

*** Variable `stack-trace-on-error' removed.

*** The debugger can now "continue" from an error, which means it will
jump to the error handler as if the debugger had not been invoked
instead of jumping all the way to the top-level.

*** Set `debug-on-event' to enter the debugger on events like SIGUSR1.
This can be useful when `inhibit-quit' is set.

** The new function `server-eval-at' allows evaluation of Lisp forms on
named Emacs server instances.

** `call-process' and `call-process-region' allow a `(:file "file")' spec
to redirect STDOUT to a file.

** The function `format-time-string' now supports the %N directive,
for higher-resolution time stamps.

** New input reading functions

*** New function `read-char-choice' reads a restricted set of
characters, discarding any inputs not inside the set.

*** The command `read-color' now requires a match for a color name
or RGB triplet, instead of signaling an error if the user provides
invalid input.

**** `facemenu-read-color' is now an alias for `read-color'.

** `image-library-alist' is renamed to `dynamic-library-alist'.
The variable is now used to load all kind of supported dynamic libraries,
not just image libraries.  The previous name is still available as an
obsolete alias.

** Syntax parsing changes

*** New variable `syntax-propertize-function'.
This replaces `font-lock-syntactic-keywords' which is now obsolete.
This allows syntax-table properties to be set independently from font-lock:
just call syntax-propertize to make sure the text is propertized.
Together with this new variable come a new hook
syntax-propertize-extend-region-functions, as well as two helper functions:
syntax-propertize-via-font-lock to reuse old font-lock-syntactic-keywords
as-is; and syntax-propertize-rules which provides a new way to specify
syntactic rules.

*** Syntax tables support a new "comment style c" additionally to style b.

** New hook `post-self-insert-hook', run after `self-insert-command'.

** frame-local variables cannot be let-bound any more.

** Major and minor mode changes

*** `set-auto-mode' now respects mode: local variables at the end of files,
as well as those in the -*- line.

*** `prog-mode' is a new major mode from which programming modes
should be derived.

**** `prog-mode-hook' can be used to enable features for programming
modes, e.g. (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode) to enable
on-the-fly spell checking for comments and strings.

*** New hook `change-major-mode-after-body-hook', run by
`run-mode-hooks' just before any other mode hooks.

*** Enabled globalized minor modes can be disabled in specific major modes.
If the global mode is global-FOO-mode, then run (FOO-mode -1) in the
major mode's hook, where FOO-mode toggles the mode on a per-buffer basis.

*** `define-minor-mode' accepts new keywords :variable, :after-hook.

** File-handling changes

*** `delete-file' and `delete-directory' now accept optional arg TRASH.
Trashing is performed if TRASH and `delete-by-moving-to-trash' are
both non-nil.  Interactively, TRASH defaults to t, unless a prefix
argument is supplied (see Trash changes, above).

*** New file predicates: `file-equal-p', `file-in-directory-p'.

** Tool-bars can display separators.
Tool-bar separators are handled like menu separators in menu-bar maps,
i.e. via menu entries of the form `(menu-item "--")'.

** Image API

*** Animated images support (currently animated gifs only).

**** `image-animated-p' returns non-nil if an image can be animated.

**** `image-animate' animates a supplied image spec.

**** `image-animate-timer' returns the timer object for an image that
is being animated.

*** `image-extension-data' has been renamed to `image-metadata'.
The old name is an obsolete alias to the new one.

*** Image mode can view any image type that ImageMagick supports.
This requires Emacs to be built with ImageMagick support.

**** New function `imagemagick-types', defined if ImageMagick support
is enabled, returns a list of image file extensions that your
ImageMagick installation supports.

**** New function `imagemagick-register-types' enables ImageMagick
image types in Image mode and in `create-image' and other helper
functions.

**** New option `imagemagick-types-inhibit' excludes certain
ImageMagick image types from `imagemagick-register-types'.

**** With ImageMagick support, there are extra Image mode commands to
resize and rotate images: `image-transform-fit-to-height',
`image-transform-fit-to-width', `image-transform-set-rotation', and
`image-transform-set-scale'.

** `compose-mail' now accepts an optional 8th arg, RETURN-ACTION, and
passes it to the mail user agent function.  This argument specifies an
action for returning to the caller after finishing with the mail.  For
example, this is used by Rmail to optionally delete a mail window.

** XML and HTML parsing
If Emacs is compiled with libxml2 support, there are two new
functions: `libxml-parse-html-region' (which parses "real world" HTML)
and `libxml-parse-xml-region' (which parses XML).  Both return an
Emacs Lisp parse tree.

** Networking and encryption changes

*** `open-network-stream' can now be used to open an encrypted stream.
It now accepts an optional `:type' parameter for initiating a TLS
connection, directly or via STARTTLS.  To do STARTTLS, additional
parameters (`:end-of-command', `:success', `:capabilities-command')
must also be supplied.

*** New library gnutls.el.
The new function `gnutls-available-p' returns non-nil if Emacs is
built with GnuTLS support.  The main entry points are
`open-gnutls-stream' and `gnutls-negotiate'.  It's easiest to use
these functions through `open-network-stream', because that can
upgrade connections through STARTTLS opportunistically or use plain
SSL, depending on your needs.  For debugging, set `gnutls-log-level'
greater than 0.

*** New primitive `secure-hash' that supports many secure hash algorithms:
md5, sha1, sha2, sha224, sha256, sha384, and sha512.  The lisp library
sha1.el has been removed.  The `sha1' feature is provided by default.

** Isearch

*** New hook `isearch-update-post-hook' that runs in `isearch-update'.

** Progress reporters can now "spin".
The MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE arguments of `make-progress-reporter' can
now be nil, or omitted.  This makes a "non-numeric" reporter.  Each
time you call `progress-reporter-update' on that progress reporter,
with a nil or omitted VALUE argument, the reporter message is
displayed with a "spinning bar".

** New variable `revert-buffer-in-progress-p' is true while a buffer is
being reverted, even if the buffer has a local `revert-buffer-function'.

** New variables `delayed-warnings-list' and `delayed-warnings-hook'.
If delayed-warnings-list is non-nil, the command loop calls
`delayed-warnings-hook' after `post-command-hook'.  At present, this
is only used by Emacs on some platforms to display warnings during
startup, which might otherwise not be noticed.  This uses the
functions `display-delayed-warnings' and `collapse-delayed-warnings'.

** rx.el has a new `group-n' construct for explicitly numbered groups.

** New function `make-composed-keymap' that constructs a new keymap
from multiple input maps.  You can use this to make a keymap that
inherits from multiple maps, eg:
 (set-keymap-parent newmap (make-composed-keymap othermap parent))

** New function `string-prefix-p'.
(This was actually added in Emacs 23.2 but was not advertised at the time.)

** New reader macro ## that stands for the empty symbol.
This means that the empty symbol can now be read back.  Also, #: by itself
(when not immediately followed by a possible symbol character) stands for
an empty uninterned symbol.

** New math functions `isnan', `copysign', `frexp', `ldexp'.

** The following functions and variables are obsolete:

*** `tooltip-use-echo-area' is obsolete.
Rather than setting this to t, disable Tooltip mode instead.

*** buffer-substring-filters is obsolete.
Use `filter-buffer-substring-functions' instead.

*** `byte-compile-disable-print-circle' is obsolete.

*** `deferred-action-list' and `deferred-action-function' are obsolete.
Use `post-command-hook' instead.

*** `font-lock-maximum-size' is obsolete.


* Changes in Emacs 24.1 on Non-Free Operating Systems

** On MS Windows, Emacs warns when using the obsolete init file _emacs,
and also when HOME is set to C:\ by default.

** New configure.bat options

*** --enable-checking builds Emacs with extra runtime checks.

*** --distfiles specifies files to be included in binary distribution.

*** --without-gnutls disables automatic GnuTLS detection.

*** --lib for general library linkage, works with the USER_LIBS build variable.

** New make target `dist' to create binary distribution for MS Windows.

** The Lisp function `w32-default-color-map' is now obsolete.
(It is only used internally in the Emacs C code.)

** Customize ns-auto-hide-menu-bar to have the menu-bar hidden, but
reappear on mouse-over.  (Requires OS X 10.6 or later.)

** On Mac OS X, dragging a file into Emacs visits the file, like on
other platforms, rather than inserting its contents into the buffer.
